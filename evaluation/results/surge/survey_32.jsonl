We can find such triplets in a structured format in several publicly available knowledge bases (KBs) such as, Freebase~, DBpedia~, Wikidata~, etc. These triplets are very useful for many natural language processing tasks such as machine reading comprehension , machine translation , abstractive summarization , etc. However, building such knowledge bases is a daunting task. The aforementioned KBs are built by crowdsourcing, which may not be scalable. Although these KBs contain a large number of triplets, they remain incomplete. On the other hand, relation triplets can be automatically distilled from the copious amount of free text on the Web. This can be leveraged for identifying missing links in the existing KBs or build a KB from scratch without human intervention. \n\\begin{table*}[ht]\n\\small\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Class} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Sentence}                                                                                                                          & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{Triplets}                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\ \\hline\nNEO                                  & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}The original Joy of Cooking was published in 1931 \\\\by Irma Rombauer, a St. Louis housewife.\\end{tabular} & \\textless{}Irma Rombauer, St. Louis, place\\_lived\\textgreater{}                                                                                                                                      \\\\ \\hline\nEPO                                     & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Berlin is the capital of Germany.\\end{tabular}                                                                                                                     & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\\textless{}Germany, Berlin, capital\\textgreater\\\\ \\textless{}Germany, Berlin, contains\\textgreater\\\\ \\textless{}Berlin, Germany, country\\textgreater{}\\end{tabular} \\\\ \\hline\nSEO                                     & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Dr. C.

This table is taken from \\newcite{nayak2020deep}.}\n\\label{tab:ov_classes}\n\\end{table*}\nThere are two distinct research paradigms of relation extraction: open information extraction (Open IE) and supervised relation extraction. \\newcite{banko2007open}, \\newcite{christensen2011srlie}, \\newcite{etzioni2011reverb}, and \\newcite{schmitz2012ollie} use open information extraction (Open IE) to extract relation triplets from sentences where relations set is open. Open IE systems like KnowItAll , TEXTRUNNER , REVERB , SRLIE , and OLLIE  use rule-based methods to extract entities from the noun phrases and relations from the verb phrases present in sentences. These systems can extract a large number of triplets of diverse relations from text within a reasonable time frame. These models extract any verb phrase in the sentences as a relation thus yielding too many uninformative triplets. Also, a relation can be expressed in sentences with different surface forms (lives\\_in relation can be expressed with `lives in', `stays', `settles', `lodges', `resident of', etc) and Open IE treats them as different relations which leads to duplication of triplets.\nThe problems of the Open IE can be addressed using supervised relation extraction. In supervised relation extraction, we consider a fixed set of relations, thus there is no need to do any normalization of the extracted relations. This approach requires a large parallel corpus of text and relation triplets for training. There are some annotated and some distantly supervised parallel corpus of (text, triplets) available publicly that can be used for training the models. Creating annotated corpus is difficult and time-consuming, so datasets created in this way are relatively smaller in size. On the other hand, the distant supervision approach can be exploited to create a large training corpus automatically, but these datasets contain a significant amount of noisy labels. These noisy labels in the distantly supervised datasets can affect the performance of the models in a negative way. Several feature-based models and deep neural network-based are proposed in the last decade for relation extraction. In this survey, we discuss these datasets and models in detail in the remaining part of the paper.\nPreviously, \\newcite{Cui2017ASO,Pawar2017RelationE,Kumar2017ASO,Shi2019ABS,Han2020MoreDM} presented survey of the research works in the relation extraction, but they mostly focused on pipeline-based relation extraction approaches at the sentence-level. Different from these survey papers, we extend the survey to document-level relation extraction and joint entity and relation extraction approaches. We also survey very recent research directions in this area such as zero-shot or few-shot relation extraction and noise mitigation in distantly supervised datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper that covers so many different aspects of relation extraction in detail.\n\\begin{table*}[ht]\n\\small\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cccl}\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{Relation} & \\textcolor{red}{Entity 1} & \\textcolor{blue}{Entity 2}                                    & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{Text}                                                                                                                                                                \\\\ \\hline\nacted\\_in                        & \\textcolor{red}{Meera Jasmine} & \\textcolor{blue}{Sootradharan} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\\textcolor{red}{Meera Jasmine} made her debut in the \\\\Malayalam film ``\\textcolor{blue}{Soothradharan}\" .\\end{tabular}                                                                         \\\\ \\\\ \nlocated\\_in                    & \\textcolor{red}{Chakkarakadavu} & \\textcolor{blue}{Kerala}     & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\\textcolor{red}{Chakkarakadavu} is a small village to \\\\the east of the town of Cherai, on \\\\Vypin Island in Ernakulam district,\\\\  \\textcolor{blue}{Kerala}, India .\\end{tabular}             \\\\ \\\\\nbirth\\_place                      & \\textcolor{red}{Barack Obama} & \\textcolor{blue}{Hawaii}  & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\\textcolor{red}{Barack Obama} was born in \\textcolor{blue}{Hawaii} . \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\\\\nplays\\_for                       & \\textcolor{red}{Moussa Sylla} & \\textcolor{blue}{Horoya AC}   & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Fodé \\textcolor{red}{Moussa Sylla} is a Guinean \\\\football player, who currently plays \\\\for \\textcolor{blue}{Horoya AC} .\\end{tabular}                      \\\\ \\\\\nowns                           & \\textcolor{red}{MTV Channel} & \\textcolor{blue}{Shakthi TV}    & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\\textcolor{red}{MTV Channel} (Pvt) Ltd is a Sri \\\\Lankan media company which owns \\\\three national television channels - \\\\\\textcolor{blue}{Shakthi TV}, Sirasa TV and TV 1 .\\end{tabular} \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Examples of relation triplets found in free texts.

The relations in this dataset are not taken from any knowledge base. They represent the relationship between two nominals in the sentences. Examples of such relations are {\\em Cause-Effect, Component-Whole,} etc.  mapped Freebase  triplets to Wikipedia articles to obtain a dataset.  (NYT10) and  (NYT11) mapped Freebase triplets to the New York Times (NYT) articles to obtain a similar dataset. These two datasets are used extensively by researchers for their experiments. They have $52$ and $24$ valid relations respectively. The training and test data in NYT10 are distantly supervised, whereas in NYT11, the test data is annotated and training data is distantly supervised. Recently, \\newcite{zhu2020nyth} created an annotated test dataset for the NYT10 dataset with a subset of its relations set. This annotated test set contains 22 relations. They used a binary strategy to annotate each instance either the distantly supervised relation is present or not in the sentences. But this test dataset does not include any {\\em None} samples which makes it unsuitable for the relation extraction task. ACE04  and ACE05  are two datasets containing 7 relations. These two datasets focus on both named entity recognition and relation extraction tasks. CoNLL04  and GDS  are two other datasets with $5$ and $4$ valid relations respectively. ACE04, ACE05, CoNLL04, and GDS datasets are manually annotated but they contain few relations in comparison to distantly supervised datasets. TACRED  is another dataset for relation extraction that has manually annotated training and test data. TACRED contains 41 relations similar to that of the distantly supervised datasets. So that makes this dataset very suitable for comparing models in this task. Automatic evaluation of the models can be carried out on this dataset easily. FewRel 2.0  is a few-shot relation extraction dataset. WebNLG  is another dataset that contains $216$ relations. Recently, this dataset has been used for joint entity and relation extraction. It is curated from the original WebNLG dataset of \\newcite{Gardent2017CreatingTC}. NYT24  and NYT29  are two other popular datasets for joint extraction task. These two datasets are curated from the NYT11 and NYT10 datasets respectively after removing the sentences that do not contain any valid relation triplets. These datasets are created at the sentence level. \nWikiReading  and DocRED  are two document-level relation extraction datasets created using Wikipedia articles and Wikidata items. WikiReading is a slot-filling dataset where a document of an entity and the name of a property (same as the relation) is given to the models as input to predict the second entity. This dataset does not have any {\\em None} instances. Each document in the dataset corresponds to one instance of training or testing. DocRED, on the other hand, is a relation extraction dataset. Training data contains 4,053 documents and test data contains 1,000 documents. Each document contains multiple instances and test data is blind. \\newcite{nayak2020deep} proposed an idea of extending the relation extraction task to multi-documents. They created a 2-hop relation extraction dataset from a multi-hop question answering dataset WikiHop  that contains more relations than the previous sentence-level or document-level datasets. Their idea can be extended to create an N-hop dataset to cover more relations.

First, a convolution operation with max-pooling is used to extract the global features of the sentence. Next, attention is applied to the words of the sentence based on the two entities separately. The word embedding of the last token of an entity is concatenated with the embedding of every word. This concatenated representation is passed to a feed-forward layer with tanh activation and then another feed-forward layer with softmax to get a scalar attention score for every word of that entity. The word embeddings are averaged based on the attention scores to get the attentive feature vectors. The global feature vector and two attentive feature vectors for the two entities are concatenated and passed to a feed-forward layer with softmax to determine the relation.\n\\newcite{wang2016relation} used multi-level attention CNNs for this task. Their model achived very high F1 score on the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset. \\newcite{zhang2017position} proposed a position-aware attention mechanism over the LSTM sequences for this task. Earlier \\newcite{zeng2014relation} and \\newcite{zeng2015distant} use the position information as dense embedding in the network for feature extraction, whereas \\newcite{zhang2017position} used it in attention modeling for the same task.\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{img/multilayer_att_cnn.png}\n\\caption{The architecture of the multi-level attention CNN model .}\n\\label{fig:multi_att_cnn}\n\\end{figure}\n used a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU)  to capture the long-term dependency among the words in the sentence. The tokens vectors $\\mathbf{x}_t$ are passed to a Bi-GRU layer. The hidden vectors of the Bi-GRU layer are passed to a bi-linear operator which is a combination of two feed-forward layers with softmax to compute a scalar attention score for each word. The hidden vectors of the Bi-GRU layer are multiplied by their corresponding attention scores for scaling up the hidden vectors. A piecewise convolution neural network  is applied to the scaled hidden vectors to obtain the feature vector. This feature vector is passed to a feed-forward layer with softmax to determine the relation. \\newcite{nayak2019effective} used dependency distance based multi-focused attention model for this task. Dependency distance helps to identify the important words in the sentences and multi-factor attention helps to focus on multiple pieces of evidence for a relation. \\newcite{Bowen2019BeyondWA} used segment-level attention in their model rather than using traditional token-level attention for this task. \\newcite{Zhang2019MultilabeledRE} proposed an attention-based capsule network for relation extraction.\n have used attention model for multi-instance relation extraction. They applied attention over a bag of independent sentences containing two entities to extract the relation between them. First, CNN-based models are used to encode the sentences in a bag. Then a bi-linear attention layer is used to determine the importance of each sentence in the bag. This attention helps to mitigate the problem of noisy samples obtained by distant supervision to some extent. The idea is that clean sentences get higher attention scores over the noisy ones. The sentence vectors in the bag are merged in a weighted average fashion based on their attention scores. The weighted average vector of the sentences is passed to a feed-forward neural network with softmax to determine the relation.

They divide the SDP into two sub-paths: (i) The left SDP which goes from entity 1 to the common ancestor node (ii) The right SDP which goes from entity 2 to the common ancestor node. This common ancestor node is the lowest common ancestor between the two entities in the dependency tree. The token vectors along the left SDP and right SDP are passed to an LSTM layer separately.

They built a graph from the sentences where every word is considered as a node in the graph. Edges are created based on the adjacency of the words, dependency tree relations, and discourse relations. They extract all the paths from the graph starting from entity 1 to entity 2. Each path is represented by features such as lexical tokens, the lemma of the tokens, POS tags, etc. They use all the path features to find the relation between the two entities. \n and  used a similar graph for N-ary cross-sentence relation extraction. Rather than using explicit paths, they used an LSTM on a graph. A graph LSTM is a general structure for a linear LSTM or tree LSTM. If the graph contains only the word adjacency edges, then the graph LSTM becomes a linear LSTM. If the graph contains the edges from the dependency tree, it becomes a tree LSTM. A general graph structure may contain cycles. So  divides this graph into two directed acyclic graphs (DAG), where the forward DAG contains only the forward edges among the tokens and the backward DAG contains only the backward edges among the tokens. Each node has a separate forget gate for each of its neighbors. It receives information from the neighbors and updates its hidden states using LSTM equations . If we only consider the word adjacency edges, this graph LSTM becomes a bi-directional linear LSTM.  did not divide the graph into two DAGs, but directly used the graph structure to update the states of the nodes. At time step $t$, each node receives information from its neighbor from the previous time step and update its hidden states using LSTM equations. This process is repeated $k$ number of times where $k$ is a hyper-parameter.\n and  proposed a graph convolutional network (GCN) model which used simple linear transformations to update the node states, unlike the graph LSTMs used by  and .  gave equal weights to the edges, whereas  used an attention mechanism to assign different weights to the edges. , , and  used graph convolutional networks for sentence-level relation extraction. They considered each token in a sentence as a node in the graph and used the syntactic dependency tree to create a graph structure among the nodes.  used the GCN in a multi-instance setting.

They classify the relation between two given entities at the sentence level or the bag-of-sentences level. These models depend on an external named entity recognition system to identify the entities in a text. Recently, some researchers  tried to remove this dependency. They tried to bring the entity recognition and relation identification tasks closer by sharing their parameters and optimizing them together. They first identify all the entities in a sentence and then find the relation among all the pairs of identified entities. Although they identify the entities and relations in the same network, they still identify the entities first and then determine the relation among all possible pairs in the same network. So these models miss the interaction among the relation triplets present in a sentence. These approaches resemble the pipeline approach to some extent.\n first proposed a truly joint extraction model for this task. They used a sequence tagging scheme to jointly extract the entities and relations. They created a set of tags derived from the Cartesian product of entity tags and relation tags. These new tags can encode the entity information and relation information together. But this strategy does not work when entities are shared among multiple triplets, as only one tag can be assigned to a token.  proposed an encoder-decoder model with a copy mechanism to extract relation triplets with overlapping entities. Their model has a copy network to copy the last token of two entities from the source sentence and a classification network to classify the relation between copied tokens. Their model cannot extract the full entity names of the triplets. Their best performing model uses a separate decoder to extract each triplet. During training, they need to fix the maximum number of decoders and during inference, their model can only extract up to that fixed number of triplets. Also, due to the use of separate decoders for each triplet, their model misses the interaction among the triplets. \n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{img/ptrnet.jpg}\n\\caption{The architecture of the joint entity and relation extraction model as proposed in \\newcite{nayak2019ptrnetdecoding}.}\n\\label{fig:ptrnet}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/chart.png}\n\\caption{The statistics of the research articles published in year 2019 (CoNLL, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, IJCAI) and 2020 (COLING, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, IJCAI).

A high-level RL is used to identify the relation based on the relation-specific tokens in the sentences. After a relation is identified, a low-level RL is used to extract the two entities associated with the relation using a sequence labeling approach. This process is repeated multiple times to extract all the relation triplets present in the sentences. A special {\\em None} relation is used to identify no relation situation in the sentences. Entities extracted associated with the {\\em None} relations are ignored.  used a graph convolutional network (GCN) where they treated each token in a sentence as a node in a graph and edges were considered as relations.  used an N-gram attention mechanism with an encoder-decoder model for the completion of knowledge bases using distantly supervised data.  used the encoder-decoder framework for this task where they used a CNN-based multi-label classifier to find all the relations first, then used multi-head attention  to extract the entities corresponding to each relation. \\newcite{nayak2019ptrnetdecoding} used encoder-decoder network for this joint extraction task. They proposed a word-level decoding framework and a pointer network-based decoding framework for the same. \nCopyMTL model  was proposed to address the issues of CopyR  model. CopyR model can only extract the last token of the entities, whereas CopyMTL model used a sequence tagging approach to extract the full entity names.  decomposed the joint extraction task into two sub-tasks: (i) head entity extraction (ii) tail entity and relation extraction. They used a sequence tagging approach to solve these two sub-tasks. Similarly,  proposed a sequence tagging approach for this task. They first identified the head entities and then for each head entity and each relation, they identified the tail entities using a sequence tagging approach. They used pre-trained BERT  in their model to improve the performance. \\newcite{Yuan2020ARA} used a relation-specific attention mechanism with sequence labeling to jointly extract the entities and relations. \\newcite{wang2020tplinker} proposed a single-stage joint extraction model using entity-pair linking. They aligned the sentence tokens using the Cartesian product so that the boundary tokens of the subject and object entities are aligned. Then they used a classifier to tag each token-pair as entity head, entity tail, subject head, subject tail, object head, and object tail for each relation separately. This scheme can identity the multiple triplets with overlapping entities easily. \\newcite{sui2020jointea} proposed a bipartite matching loss in the encoder-decoder network which considers the group of relation triplets as a set, not as a sequence. \\newcite{ye2020contrastive} transformer-based generative model for this task. They used negative triplets to train the transformer model in contrastive settings. \\newcite{Wang2020TwoAB} proposed a table-sequence encoder model where the sequence encoder captures the entity-related information and the table encoder captures the relation-specific information. \\newcite{Sun2020RecurrentIN} proposed a recurrent multi-task learning architecture to explicitly capture the interaction between entity recognition task and relation classification task. \\newcite{Ji2020SpanbasedJE} proposed a span-based multi-head attention network for joint extraction task.
