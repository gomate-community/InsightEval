"Multimodal Learning with Transformers: \\\\ A Survey"], ["section", "Introduction"]], "content": "\\label{sec:introduction}}\nThe initial inspiration of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nis {to imitate human perception}, \\eg, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling.\nIn general, a {modality} is often associated with a specific sensor that creates a unique communication channel, such as vision and language  .\nIn humans,\na fundamental mechanism in our sensory perception is the ability to leverage multiple modalities of perception data collectively in order to engage ourselves properly with the world under dynamic unconstrained circumstances, with each modality serving as a distinct information source characterized by different statistical properties.\nFor example, an image gives the visual appearance of an ``elephants playing in water'' scene via thousands of pixels, whilst the corresponding text describes this moment with a sentence using discrete words.\nFundamentally, a multimodal AI system needs to ingest, interpret, and reason about multimodal information sources to realize similar human level perception abilities.\n{Multimodal learning} (MML) is a general approach to building AI models that can extract and relate information from multimodal data .\nThis survey focuses on multimodal learning with Transformers  (as demonstrated in Figure \\ref{fig:transformer}), inspired by their intrinsic advantages and scalability in modelling different modalities (\\eg, language, visual, auditory) and tasks (\\eg, language translation, image recognition, speech recognition) with fewer  modality-specific architectural assumptions (\\eg, translation invariance and local grid attention bias in vision) .\nConcretely, the input to a Transformer could encompass one or multiple sequences of tokens, and each sequence's attribute (\\eg, the modality label, the sequential order),\nnaturally allowing for MML without architectural modification .\nFurther, learning per-modal specificity and inter-modal correlation \ncan be simply realized by controlling the input pattern of self-attention.\nCritically, there is a recent surge of research attempts and activities across distinct disciplines  exploring the Transformer architectures, resulting in a large  number of novel MML methods being developed in recent years, along with significant and diverse advances in various areas\n.\nThis calls for a timely review and summary of representative methods to enable researchers to understand the global picture of the MML field across related disciplines and more importantly to capture a holistic structured picture of  current achievements as well as major challenges.\n\\keypoint{Taxonomy}\nFor better readability and reachability from and across different disciplines, \nwe adopt a {two-tier} structured taxonomy\nbased on the application and challenge dimensions respectively.\nThis has several benefits:\n(1) Researchers with expertise in specific applications\ncan find \nthose applications appropriate to their own research domain\nbefore connecting to other related domains.\n(2) Similar model designs and architectures developed in different domains\ncan be summarized in an abstract, formula-driven perspective so that the mathematical ideas of various models formed in different applications can be correlated and contrasted on common ground, crossing domain-specific restrictions.\nCrucially, our taxonomy offers an interesting stereo-view of individual works\nwith the insights in both application specificity and formulation generality.\nIt is hoped that this can help to break down domain boundaries\nand foster more effective idea communication and exchange across modalities.\nBy using the prompt modelling strategy   as a basis for investigation, we also include \nthe classical classification problem (\\eg, image classification) -- usually regarded\nas a single modality learning application in conventional MML surveys  --\nas a special MML application.\nThis has the potential to significantly enrich MML, as the classification problem\nis an AI topic amongst the most extensive studies in the literature .\n\\keypoint{Scope}\nThis survey will discuss the multimodality specific designs of Transformer architecture including, but not limited to, the following modalities:\nRGB image , depth image , \\blue{multispectral image }, video , audio/speech/music ,\ntable , scene graph/layout ,\npose skeleton , SQL , \nrecipe , programming language ,\nsign language ,\npoint cloud ,\nsymbolic knowledge (graph) , multimodal knowledge graph , sketch drawing , 3D object/scene , document , programming code  and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) -- a kind of graph , optical flow ,\n medical knowledge (\\eg, diagnosis code ontology ).\nNote that this survey will not discuss the multimodal papers where Transformer is used simply  as the feature extractor without multimodal designs.\n\\keypoint{Related Surveys}\nWe relate this paper to existing surveys \nof the two specific dimensions MML and Transformers.\nThere exist a few MML surveys .\nIn particular,  proposed a structured, acknowledged taxonomy by five challenges, which we also adopt\nas part of our structure.\nUnlike , and , which review general machine learning models,\nwe instead focus on Transformer architectures and their self-attention mechanisms.\nSeveral surveys dedicated to Transformers have been recently introduced, with a range of emphases including \ngeneral Transformers ,\nefficient designs ,\nvisualization ,\ncomputer vision tasks ,\nmedical imaging ,\nvideo tasks , and \nvision language pretraining .\nWhile  consider MML,\ntheir reviews are somewhat  limited in the scope, taxonomy, and coverage.\nTo our knowledge, only a few surveys on video-language pretraining (VLP)   are relevant to MML.\nHowever, VLP is only a subdomain of MML.\nIn this survey, we focus solely on the intersection of multimodal learning and Transformers.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\t\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{./figures/transformer.png}\n\t\\caption{Overview of Transformer

where the token embeddings from multiple modalities can be weighted summed at each token position and then processed by Transformer layers:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:early-summation}\n   \\mathbf{Z} \\gets Tf(\\alpha \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})} \\oplus \\beta \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})}) = {MHSA} (\\mathbf{Q}_{(\\texttt{AB})}, \\mathbf{K}_{(\\texttt{AB})}, \\mathbf{V}_{(\\texttt{AB})}), \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\oplus$ is element-wise sum, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are weightings.\nConcretely, $\\mathbf{Q}_{(\\texttt{AB})} = (\\alpha \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})} \\oplus \\beta \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})}) \\mathbf{W}^{Q}_{(\\texttt{AB})}$, $\\mathbf{K}_{(\\texttt{AB})} = (\\alpha \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})} \\oplus \\beta \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})}) \\mathbf{W}^{K}_{(\\texttt{AB})}$, and $\\mathbf{V}_{(\\texttt{AB})} = (\\alpha \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})} \\oplus \\beta \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})}) \\mathbf{W}^{V}_{(\\texttt{AB})}$.\n{Its main advantage is that it does not increase computational complexity.\nHowever, its main disadvantage is due to the manually set weightings.} \nAs discussed in Section \\ref{sec:tokenized-input} and \\ref{sec:multimodal-input}, summing position embedding is intrinsically a case of early summation.\n\\keypoint{(2) Early Concatenation}\nAnother straightforward solution is early concatenation  that the token embedding sequences from multiple modalities are concatenated and input into Transformer layers as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:early-concatenation}\n    \\mathbf{Z} \\gets Tf(\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})}, \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})})).\n\\end{equation}\n{Thus, all the multimodal token positions can be attended as a whole sequence, such that the positions of each modality can be encoded well by conditioning the context of other modalities.}\nVideoBERT  is the one of the first multimodal Transformer works, where video and text are fused via early concatenation {that can encode the global multimodal context well .\nHowever, the longer sequence after concatenation will increase computational complexity.}\nEarly concatenation is also termed  ``all-attention'' or ``Co-Transformer'' .\n\\keypoint{(3) Hierarchical Attention} (multi-stream to one-stream)\nTransformer layers can be combined hierarchically to attend to the cross-modal interactions.\nA common practice is that multimodal inputs are encoded by independent Transformer streams and their outputs are concatenated and fused by another Transformer :\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:hierarchical-attention-2-to-1}\n    \\mathbf{Z} \\gets Tf_3(\\mathcal{C}(Tf_1(\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})}), Tf_2(\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})}))).\n\\end{equation}\nThis kind of hierarchical attention is an implementation of late interaction/fusion, and  can be treated as a special case of early concatenation.\n\\keypoint{(4) Hierarchical Attention} (one-stream to multi-stream)\nInterBERT  is another good practice of hierarchical attention where concatenated multimodal inputs are encoded by a shared single-stream Transformer that is followed by two separate Transformer streams.\nThis flow can be formulated as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:hierarchical-attention-1-to-2}\n    \\left\\{ \n    \\begin{aligned}\n        \\blue{\\mathcal{C}(}\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})}, \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})}\\blue{)} & \\gets Tf_{1}(\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})}, \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})})), \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})} & \\gets Tf_{2}(\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})}), \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})} & \\gets Tf_{3}(\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})}).\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\n{This method perceives the cross-modal interactions and meanwhile preserves the independence of uni-modal representation.}\n\\keypoint{(5) Cross-Attention}\nFor two-stream Transformers, if the $\\mathbf{Q}$ (Query) embeddings are exchanged/swapped in a cross-stream manner, the cross-modal interactions can also be perceived.\nThis method is termed cross-attention or co-attention , which was first proposed in VilBERT :\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:cross-attention}\n    \\left\\{ \n    \\begin{aligned}\n        \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})} & \\gets {MHSA} (\\mathbf{Q}_{\\texttt{B}}, \\mathbf{K}_{\\texttt{A}}, \\mathbf{V}_{\\texttt{A}}), \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})} & \\gets {MHSA} (\\mathbf{Q}_{\\texttt{A}}, \\mathbf{K}_{\\texttt{B}}, \\mathbf{V}_{\\texttt{B}}).\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\n{Cross-attention attends to each modality\nconditioned on the other and does not cause higher computational complexity, however if considered for each modality, this method fails to perform  cross-modal attention globally and thus loses the whole context.\nAs discussed in , \ntwo-stream cross-attention can learn cross-modal interaction, whereas there is no self-attention to the self-context inside each modality.}\n\\keypoint{(6) Cross-Attention to Concatenation}\nThe two streams of cross-attention  can be further concatenated and processed by another Transformer to model the global context.\nThis kind of hierarchically cross-modal interaction is also widely studied\n, and {alleviates the drawback of cross-attention.}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:cross-attention-to-concatenation}\n    \\left\\{ \n    \\begin{aligned}\n        \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})} & \\gets {MHSA} (\\mathbf{Q}_{\\texttt{B}}, \\mathbf{K}_{\\texttt{A}}, \\mathbf{V}_{\\texttt{A}}), \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})} & \\gets {MHSA} (\\mathbf{Q}_{\\texttt{A}}, \\mathbf{K}_{\\texttt{B}}, \\mathbf{V}_{\\texttt{B}}), \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Z} & \\gets Tf(\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{A})}, \\mathbf{Z}_{(\\texttt{B})})).\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\n\\keypoint{Discussion}\n{All these aforementioned self-attention variants for multimodal interactions are modality-generic, and can be applied in flexible strategies and for multi-granular tasks.\nSpecifically, these interactions can be flexibly combined and nested.}\nFor instance, multiple cross-attention streams are used in hierarchical attention (one-stream to multi-stream) that in a two-stream decoupled model  $Tf_2$ and $Tf_3$ of Eq. \\ref{eq:hierarchical-attention-1-to-2} are implemented by cross-attention defined in Eq. \\ref{eq:cross-attention}. \n{Moreover, they can be extended to multiple ($\\geq 3$) modalities.}\nTriBERT  is a tri-modal cross-attention (co-attention) for vision, pose, and audio, where given a Query embedding, its Key and Value embeddings are the concatenation from the other modalities.

A great deal of excellent work has been proposed, \\eg, \nVideoBERT ,\nViLBERT ,\nLXMERT ,\nVisualBERT ,\nVL-BERT ,\nUNITER ,\nCBT ,\nUnicoder-VL ,\nB2T2 ,\nVLP ,\n12-in-1 ,\nOscar ,\nPixel-BERT ,\nActBERT ,\nImageBERT ,\nHERO ,\nUniVL , SemVLP . \n{\\textbf{(2)}} {Speech can be used as text.} Thanks to  recent advances in  automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques, in a multimodal context, speech can be converted to text by the\n off-the-shelf speech\nrecognition tools. \nFor instance, VideoBERT  and CBT  make full use of speech rather than low-level sounds as a source of cross-modal supervision, by extracting  high-level semantic text.\n{\\textbf{(3)}} {Overly dependent on the well-aligned multimodal data.} A majority of Transformer-based multimodal pretraining works in a self-supervised manner, however, it is overly dependent on the well-aligned multimodal sample pairs/tuples.\nFor instance, large amount of image-language pretraining Transformer models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs, \\eg,\nVisualBERT , VL-BERT ,  ViLBERT ,\nLXMERT , UNITER .\nFor another example,\nthe instructional videos (\\eg, cooking) \\footnote{{Note that instructional videos also have weakly aligned cases .}} are widely used as the pretraining corpora, \\eg,\nHowToVQA69M ,\nHowTo100M ,\nas {in general,}\ntheir visual clues/content and the spoken words have a higher probability to align with each other, {if compared with other videos.} \nHowever, using  cross-modal alignment as cross-modal supervision is costly for large-scale applications.\nThus, how to use the weakly-aligned or even unpaired/unaligned  multimodal data as the pretraining corpora is still understudied. Some recent attempts  study the use of weakly-aligned cross-modal supervision  to train Transformers to learn the cross-modal interactions. \n{\\textbf{(4)}} \n{Most of the existing pretext tasks transfer well across modalities.}\nFor instance, Masked Language Modelling (MLM) in the text domain has been applied to audio and image, \\eg,  Masked Acoustic Modelling , Masked Image Region Prediction ,\nwhile both Sentence Ordering Modelling (SOM)  in text domain and Frame Ordering Modelling (FOM)  in video domain share the same idea.  \nWe will further discuss the pretext tasks for multimodal Transformer pretraining in the follows.\n{\\textbf{(5)}} {Model structures are mainly in three categories.} Essentially, in multimodal pretraining scenarios, Transformer models work based on those self-attention variants that are discussed in Section \\ref{sec:self-attention-in-multimodal-context}. Thus, if considered from the perspective of model structures, the existing Transformers for multimodal pretraining are also mainly in three categories, \\ie, single-stream, multi-stream, hybrid-stream. \n{\\textbf{(6)}}\n{Cross-modal interactions can perform within various components/levels in the pretraining pipelines.}\nFor  Transformer based multimodal pretraining, the key is to drive the Transformer (encoder w/, w/o decoder) to learn the cross-modal interactions.\nIn the existing Transformer-based multimodal pretraining practices, the cross-modal interactions are flexible, which can perform within various components/levels in the pretraining pipelines.\nIn general, Transformer-based multimodal pretraining pipelines have three key components, from bottom to top, \\ie, tokenization, Transformer representation, objective supervision. \nFor not only the multimodal pretraining but also the specific multimodal tasks,\nthe cross-modal interactions can perform within arbitrary component(s) of the three.\nAs discussed in Section \\ref{sec:self-attention-in-multimodal-context},\nbecause self-attention models the embedding of an arbitrary token from an arbitrary modality as a node of a graph,\n the existing pretraining pipelines\ncan, in general, be transferred independently across\nmodalities,\nunless considered with modality-specific objectives.\n\\keypoint{Discussion} Vision Language Pretraining (VLP) follows two general pipelines: two-stage (need object detector, \\eg, Faster R-CNN ) (\\eg, LXMERT , ViLBert , VL-Bert , UNITER ) and end-to-end (\\eg, Pixel-Bert , SOHO , KD-VLP , Simvlm ). \nTwo-stage pipelines have a main advantage -- object-aware perceiving, by using the supervised pre-trained visual detectors, \nhowever these are based on a strong assumption that the visual representations can be fixed.\n\\keypoint{Discussion}\nHow to look for more corpora that intrinsically have well-aligned cross-modal supervision, such as instructional videos, is still an open problem.\nHowever,\nweakly-aligned cross-modal samples are popular in the real-life scenarios, for instance, enormous weakly aligned multimodal\ndata samples are emerging in e-commerce , due to fine-grained categories, complex combinations, and fuzzy correspondence.\nWell labelled/aligned cross-modal datasets are very costly in collecting and annotating;  \nhow to use weakly-aligned or even unaligned corpora crawled from the web is a promising question. \nSome recently successful practice \nused weakly aligned image-text pairs\nto perform pretraining, and achieve both competitive performance and zero-shot learning capability for image classification, image-text retrieval, and open-ended visual question answering, \\etc.\nBecause these practices in weak supervision  make full use of large-scale pretraining corpora, they yield greater promise of zero-shot generalization.\n\\keypoint{Pretext Tasks}\nIn Transformer based multimodal pretraining,\nthe pretraining tasks/objectives are also termed  pretext tasks/objectives.\nTo date, various pretext tasks have been studied, \\eg, masked language modelling (MLM) ,\nmasked image region prediction/{classification} (also termed  masked object classification (MOC)) ,\nmasked region regression (MRR) ,\nvisual-linguistic matching (VLM) (\\eg, image–text\nmatching (ITM) , image text matching (ITM), phrase-region alignment (PRA) , word-region alignment (WRA) , video-subtitle matching (VSM) ),\nmasked frame modelling (MFM) ,\nframe order modelling (FOM) ,\nnext sentence prediction (NSP) ,\nmasked sentence generation (MSG) ,\nmasked group modelling (MGM) , \nprefix language modelling (PrefixLM) ,\nvideo conditioned masked\nlanguage model ,\ntext conditioned masked frame\nmodel ,\nvisual translation language modelling\n(VTLM) , and\nimage-conditioned masked language modelling (also termed  image-attended masked language modelling) .\n These down-stream task -agnostic pretext pretraining is optional,\nand the down-stream task objectives can be trained directly,\nwhich will be discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:task-specific-multi-modal-pretraining}.\n{Table~\\ref{table:pretext-tasks} provides the common and representative pretext tasks for Transformer based multimodal pretraining.}\n\\blue{In practice, pretext tasks can be combined, and some representative cases are summarized in Table 3 of , Table 2 of .} \n\\input{tables/pretext-tasks}\nThe pretext tasks have multiple taxonomies: \n{\\textbf{(1)}} {Supervision.}\n{The common multimodal pretraining Transformers use well-aligned,  weakly-aligned, and even unaligned multimodal sample pairs/tuples, to work in supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised manners, respectively.}\nMeanwhile, \nif we consider the definitions of their pretext tasks/objectives from supervision, the pretexts can be sorted into unsupervised/self-supervised (\\eg, masked language modelling (MLM) )  and supervised (\\eg, image-text matching (ITM)     ), \\etc.\nNowadays, self-supervised attempts are the majority. \n{\\textbf{(2)}} {Modality.} Considering the mathematical formulations, some pretexts are defined on single modality, \\eg, masked language modelling , masked acoustic modelling , masked region regression (MRR) ,\nwhile other pretexts are defined on multiple modalities, \\eg, image-conditioned masked language modelling (IMLM) , image-text matching (ITM) , video-subtitle matching (VSM) .\nThus, from this mathematical view, the pretext tasks can be  divided into two categories, \\ie, uni-modal and multimodal.  \nHowever, this classification is not really accurate.\nIt should be highlighted that in multimodal pretraining Transformer models, even if the pretext objective formulations only include uni-modal elements, pretexts can still involve other modalities, essentially conditioned on the clues from other modalities, by (a) prepositive token level interactions and/or Transformer level interactions, \n(b) co-training with other pretexts that involve other modalities. \nFor instance, VL-BERT  uses two dual pretext tasks, \\ie, masked language modelling and masked RoI classification.\n{\\textbf{(3)}} {Motivation.} If consider their motivations, the pretext tasks include masking, describing, matching, ordering, \\etc.\nSome recent surveys focus on VLP and compare the existing VLP Transformer models from the angles of domain (image-text or video-text), vision feature extraction, language feature extraction, architecture (single- or dual- stream), decoder (w/, w/o), pretext tasks/objectives, pretraining datasets, and down-stream tasks, \\eg, Table 3 of , Table 2 of .\nDifferent from these views,\nin this survey,\nwe would propose our comparisons from some new perspectives.\nSpecifically:\n{\\textbf{(1)}}\nThe core of Transformer ecosystem is self-attention, thus we would compare the existing multimodal pretraining Transformer models from the angles of how and when the self-attention or its variants perform cross-modal interactions. \n{\\textbf{(2)}} Considering from a geometrically topological perspective, self-attention helps Transformers intrinsically \nwork in a modality agnostic pipeline that is compatible\nwith various modalities by taking in the embedding of each\ntoken as a node of graph, thus we would highlight that the existing VLP can be applied to other modalities, beyond visual and linguistic domains. \n{\\textbf{(3)}} \nWe suggest to treat the Transformer-based multimodal pretraining pipelines having three key components, from bottom to top, \\ie, tokenization, Transformer representation, objective supervision. \n\\keypoint{Discussion}\nIn spite of the recent advances,\nmultimodal pretraining Transformer methods still have some obvious bottlenecks.\n\\magenta{For instance,\nas discussed by  in VLP field,\nwhile the BERT-style cross-modal pretraining models produce excellent results on various down-stream vision-language tasks, they fail to be applied to generative tasks directly.}\nAs discussed in ,\nboth VideoBERT  and CBT  have to train a separate video-to-text decoder for video captioning.\nThis is a significant gap between the pretraining models designed for discriminative and generative tasks, as the main reason is discriminative task oriented pretraining models do not involve the decoders of Transformer.\nTherefore, how to design more unified pipelines that can work for both discriminative and generative down-stream tasks is also an open problem to be solved.\nAgain for instance,\ncommon multimodal pretraining models often underperform for fine-grained/instance-level tasks as discussed by .\n\\keypoint{Discussion}\n\\magenta{As discussed in ,\nthe masked language\nand region modelling as pre-training task have a main advantage that the Transformer encoder learned from these supervisions can encode both vision and language patterns based on bidirectional context and it is naturally fit for the semantic understanding tasks, \\eg, VQA, image-text retrieval.}\n\\keypoint{Discussion}\nHow to boost the performance for multimodal pretraining Transformers is an open problem.\nSome practices demonstrate that \nmulti-task training (by adding auxiliary loss)  and adversarial training  improve multimodal pretraining Transformers to further boost the performance. \nMeanwhile, overly compound\npretraining objectives potentially upgrade the challenge of balancing among different loss terms, thus complicate the training optimization .\nMoreover, \nthe difficulty of the pretexts is also worth discussing.\nIn general, if aim to learn more explicit object concepts, more complex pretext losses will be used . However, for pretexts, whether more complexity is better remains a question.", "cites": [5252, 7905, 1275, 7080, 7913, 2018, 5285, 7912, 2011, 2012, 2023, 5283, 5287, 5289, 2422, 2017, 2015, 8886, 5266, 5290, 7535, 1278, 5281, 1272, 5286, 5288, 5292, 768, 7906, 5282, 7, 7121, 2022, 7339, 5293, 5278, 1639, 209, 5260, 5244, 5291, 7909, 1279], "cite_extract_rate": 0.9347826086956522, "origin_cites_number": 46, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple papers to highlight trends in multimodal pretraining, particularly in the use of weakly-aligned data and pretext tasks.

VILLA  is a two-stage  strategy (task-agnostic adversarial pretraining, followed by task-specific adversarial finetuning) that improves VLP Transformers.\nIn practice,\nthe distribution gap between training data and practical data is noticeable.\nFor instance,\nsupervised data samples (well-labelled, well-aligned) are costly in practical applications, thus\nhow to transfer the supervised multimodal Transformers pretrained on well-aligned cross-modal pairs/tuples to the weakly aligned test bed is challenging .  \nCLIP  is an inspiring solution that transfers knowledge across modalities by learning a shared multimodal embedding space, enabling zero-shot transfer\nof the model to down-stream tasks.\nThe main inspiration that CLIP presents the community is that the pretrained multimodal (image and text) knowledge can be transferred to down-stream zero-shot image prediction by using a prompt template ``\\texttt{A photo of a \\{label\\}.}'' to bridge the distribution gap between training and test datasets.\nOver-fitting is a major obstacle to transfer. Multimodal Transformers can be overly fitted to the dataset\nbiases during training, due to the large modelling capability.\nSome recent practices exploit how to transfer the oracle model trained on noiseless dataset to real dataset.\nFor instance, \nKervadec \\etal  explore \nhow transferable reasoning patterns are in VQA,\nand demonstrate that for LXMERT /BERT-like\nreasoning patterns can be partially transferred from an ideal dataset to a real dataset.\nCross-task gap is another major obstacle to transfer , due to the different reasoning and input-output workflows, \\eg,\nhow to use multimodal datasets to finetune the language pretrained model is difficult .\nIn real applications, \nmultimodal pretrained Transformers sometimes need to handle the uni-modal data at inference stage due to the issue of missing modalities.

excel across all the unimodal and multimodal down-stream tasks with different characteristics simultaneously  is a non-trivial challenge.\nFor instance, two-stream architectures  are typically preferred over one-stream ones \nfor cross-modal retrieval-like tasks in efficiency, since the representation of each modality can be pre-computed beforehand and reused repeatedly. \nThat being said, how to design task-agnostic MML architectures is still an open challenge, in addition to other design choices such as pretext and objective loss functions.\nFurthermore, a clear gap remains\nbetween the state-of-the-art and this ultimate goal.\nIn general, existing multimodal Transformer models \nare superior only for specific MML tasks,\nas they are designed specifically for only a subset of specific tasks\n.\nEncouragingly, several recent studies towards { universal modality learning} in terms of modality-agnostic network design  and more task-generic architecture design  have been introduced,\nand it is hoped this will spark further investigation.\nTo that end, instead of exhaustively exploring the vast model design space, {seeking in-depth understanding and interpretation of a MML model's behaviour might be insightful for superior algorithm design}, even though the interactions and synergy across different modalities are intrinsically complex and even potentially inconsistent over tasks\n.\nFor more fine-grained MML, it is widely acknowledged that discovering the latent semantic alignments across modalities is critical.\nAn intuitive strategy is to leverage semantic parts (\\eg, objects) pre-extracted by an off-the-shelf detector for MML .\nThis, however, is not only complex and error-prone, but computationally costly .\nSeveral remedies introduced recently include\nrandom sampling ,\nlearning concept dictionary ,\njointly learning a region detector , and\nrepresentation aligning before mask prediction .\nGiven the scale of MML training data, exploring this direction\nneeds exhaustive computational costs, and\nit is supposed that industrial research teams with rich resources are more likely to afford. \n{Ideally, a favourable MML method would leave fine-grained\nsemantic alignment across modalities to emerge on its own},\nwhich is worthy of careful investigation in the future.\nAs the learning scale expands exponentially,\nthe training data become inevitably noisy and heterogeneous .\nIt has been recently shown that  properly tackling  the noise issue is useful .\nAnother related facet is training strategy,\n\\eg, how many stages of training is superior over the common one-stage policy .\nFurther, the quadratic complexity with Transformers\nbecomes more acute for multimodal data due to longer input.\nDespite extensive research on efficient variants ,\n{dedicated efficiency study for MML is still underestimated even empirically and call for more investigation}.\nIdentifying the strengths of Transformers for multimodal machine learning is a big open problem.\nThe following main points can be summarized from the literature:\n{\\textbf{(1)}} Transformers can encode implicit knowledge .\n{\\textbf{(2)}} The multi-head brings multiple modelling sub-spaces that can further enhance the expressive ability of the model.\nIdeally, multiple heads after training are good and different.\nThis is essentially a good practice of ensemble learning.\n{\\textbf{(3)}} Transformers intrinsically have a nature of global aggregation that perceives the non-local patterns. \n{\\textbf{(4)}} Thanks to the large model capacity, Transformer models handle the challenging domain gaps and shifts (\\eg, linguistic and visual) better via effective pretraining on large-scale corpora .\n{\\textbf{(5)}} Transformers can represent the inputs as graphs, which are\nintrinsically compatible with more modalities, \\eg, table and SQL.\n{\\textbf{(6)}} For modelling series and sequence patterns (\\eg, time-series), Transformers have better training and inference efficiency against RNN-based models,\nthanks to their parallel computation in training and/or inference. \nTransformers are inherently permutation invariant for processing a sequence of points, \\eg, well-suited for point cloud learning .\n{\\textbf{(7)}} Tokenization makes Transformers flexible to organize  multimodal inputs, as discussed in
