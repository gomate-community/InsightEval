However, when models are deployed in an \\emph{open-world} scenario~, test samples can be out-of-distribution (OOD) and therefore should be handled with caution. \nThe distributional shifts can be caused by semantic shift (\\eg OOD samples are drawn from different classes)~, or covariate shift (\\eg OOD samples from a different domain)~.\nThe detection of semantic distribution shift (\\eg due to the occurrence of new classes) is the focal point of OOD detection tasks, where the label space $\\mathcal{Y}$ can be different between ID and OOD data and hence the model should not make any prediction. In addition to OOD detection, several problems adopt the ``open-world'' assumption and have a similar goal of identifying OOD examples. These include outlier detection~(OD)~, anomaly detection~(AD)~, novelty detection~(ND)~, and open set recognition~(OSR)~. \nWhile all these problems are related to each other by sharing similar motivations, subtle differences exist among the \\emph{sub-topics} in terms of the specific definition. \nHowever, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the different sub-topics leads to confusion for both researchers and practitioners. Even worse, these sub-topics, which are supposed to be compared and learned from each other, are developing in isolation.\nIn this survey, we for the first time clarify the similarities and differences between these problems, and present a unified framework termed \\emph{generalized OOD detection}.\nUnder this framework, the five problems (\\ie AD, ND, OSR, OOD detection, and OD) can be viewed as special cases or sub-topics. \nWhile other sub-topics have been extensively surveyed, the summarization of OOD detection methods is still inadequate and requires further exploration. This paper fills this gap by focusing specifically on recent technical developments in OOD detection, analyzing fair experimental comparisons among classical methods on common benchmarks. Our survey concludes by highlighting open challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.\nWe further conduct a literature review for each sub-topic, with a special focus on the OOD detection task.

To this end, we provide a clear introduction and description of each sub-topic in respective subsections (from Section~\\ref{sec:tax_anomaly} to \\ref{sec:tax_od}). Each subsection details the motivation, background, formal definition, as well as relative position within the unified framework. \nApplications and benchmarks are also introduced, with concrete examples that facilitate understanding.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:benchmark} illustrates the settings for each sub-topic.\nIn the end, we conclude this section by introducing the neighborhood topics to clarify the scope of the generalized OOD detection framework. (Section~\\ref{sec:related_topics}).\n\\keypoint{Preliminary: Distribution Shift} \n\\revise{\nIn our framework, we recognize the complexity and interconnectedness of distribution shifts, which are central to understanding various OOD scenarios. Distribution shifts can be broadly categorized into \\textit{covariate shift} and \\textit{semantic (label) shift}, but it's important to clarify their interdependence.\nFirstly, let's define the input space as $\\mathcal{X}$ (sensory observations) and the label space as $\\mathcal{Y}$ (semantic categories). The data distribution is represented by the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$ over the space $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y}$.\nDistribution shift can occur in either the marginal distribution $P(X)$, or both $P(Y)$ and $P(X)$. Note that shift in $P(Y)$ naturally triggers shift in $P(X)$.\n\\keypoint{Covariate Shift:} This occurs when there is a change in the marginal distribution $P(X)$, affecting the input space, while the label space $\\mathcal{Y}$ remains constant. \nExamples of covariate distribution shift on $P(X)$ include adversarial examples~, domain shift~, and style changes~.\n\\keypoint{Semantic Shift:} This involves changes in both $P(Y)$ and indirectly $P(X)$. A shift in the label space $P(Y)$ implies the introduction of new categories or the alteration of existing ones. This change naturally affects the input space $P(X)$ since the nature of the data being observed or collected is now different. \n\\keypoint{Remark:} Given the interdependence between $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$, it's crucial to distinguish the intentions behind different types of distribution shifts. We define \\textit{Covariate Shift} as scenarios where changes are intended in the input space ($P(X)$) without any deliberate alteration to the label space ($P(Y)$). On the other hand, \\textit{Semantic Shift} specifically aims to modify the semantic content, directly impacting the label space ($P(Y)$) and, consequently, the input space ($P(X)$).\nImportantly, we note that covariate shift is more commonly used to evaluate model \\emph{generalization} and robustness performance, where the label space $\\mathcal{Y}$ remains the same during test time. On the other hand, the detection of semantic distribution shift (\\eg due to the occurrence of new classes) is the focal point of many \\emph{detection} tasks considered in this framework, where the label space $\\mathcal{Y}$ can be different between ID and OOD data and hence the model should not make any prediction.\n}\nWith the concept of distribution shift in mind, readers can get a general idea of the differences and connections among sub-topics/tasks in Fig.~\\ref{fig:taxonomy}. \nNotice that different sub-tasks can be easily identified with the following four dichotomies: \n1) covariate/semantic shift dichotomy; \n2) single/multiple class dichotomy; \n3) ID classification needed/non-needed dichotomy; \n4) inductive/transductive dichotomy.\nNext, we proceed with elaborating on each sub-topic.", "cites": [892, 917], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes concepts from multiple papers by integrating the idea of distribution shifts into a unified framework for OOD detection.

The deviation can happen due to either covariate shift or semantic shift, which leads to two sub-tasks: sensory AD and semantic AD, respectively~.\nSensory AD detects test samples with covariate shift, under the assumption that normalities come from the same covariate distribution. No semantic shift takes place in sensory AD settings.\nOn the other hand, semantic AD detects test samples with label shift, assuming that normalities come from the same semantic distribution (category), \\ie normalities should belong to only one class.\nFormally, in sensory AD, normalities are from in-distribution $P(X)$ while anomalies encountered at test time are from out-of-distribution $P'(X)$, where $P(X) \\neq P'(X)$ --- only covariate shift occurs.\nThe goal in sensory AD is to detect samples from $P'(X)$.\nNo semantic shift occurs in this setting, \\ie $P(Y)=P'(Y)$. Conversely, for semantic AD, only semantic shift occurs (\\ie $P(Y) \\neq P'(Y)$) and the goal is to detect samples that belong to novel classes.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Remark: Sensory/Semantic Dichotomy}\nOur sensory/semantic dichotomy for the AD sub-task definition comes from the low-level sensory anomalies and high-level semantic anomalies that are introduced in ~ and highlighted in the recent AD survey~, to reflect the rise of deep learning. Note that although most sensory and semantic AD methods are shown to be mutually inclusive due to the common shift on $P(X)$, some approaches are specialized in one of the sub-tasks (ref.~Section~\\ref{sec:anomaly}).\nRecent research communities are also trending on subdividing types of anomalies to develop targeted methods, so that practitioners can select the optimal solution for their own practical problem~.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Position in Framework}\nUnder the generalized OOD detection framework, the definition of ``normality'' seamlessly connects to the notion of ``in-distribution\", and ``anomaly'' corresponds to ``out-of-distribution\".\nImportantly, AD treats ID samples as a whole, which means that regardless of the number of classes (or statistical modalities) in ID data, AD does not require differentiation in the ID samples. This feature is an important distinction between AD and other sub-topics such as OSR and OOD detection.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Application and Benchmark}\nSensory AD only focuses on objects with the same or similar semantics, and identifies the observational differences on their surface. Samples with sensory differences are recognized as sensory anomalies. \nExample applications include adversarial defense~, forgery recognition of biometrics and artworks~, image forensics~, industrial inspection~, \\etc.\nThe most popular academic AD benchmark is MVTec-AD~ for industrial inspection.\nIn contrast to sensory AD, semantic AD only focuses on the semantic shift. \nAn example of real-world applications is crime surveillance~.\nActive image crawlers for a specific category also need semantic AD methods to ensure the purity of the collected images~.\nAn example of the academic benchmarks is to recursively use one class from MNIST as ID during training, and ask the model to distinguish it from the rest of the 9 classes during testing.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Evaluation}\nIn the AD benchmarks, test samples are annotated to be either normal or abnormal. \nThe deployed anomaly detector will produce a confidence score for a test sample, indicating how confident the model considers the sample as normality.\nSamples below the predefined confidence threshold are considered abnormal.\nBy viewing the anomalies as positive and\ntrue normalities as negative\\footnote{Align with MSP~. Check \\href{https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD/issues/206}{this issue} in OpenOOD}, different thresholds will produce a series of true positive rates (TPR) and false-positive rates (FPR)---from which we can calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)~. Similarly, the precision and recall values can be used to compute metrics of F-scores and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR)~.\nNote that there can be two variants of AUPR values: one treating ``normal'' as the positive class, and the other treating ``abnormal'' as the positive class. For AUROC and AUPR, a higher value indicates better detection performance.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Remark: Alternative Taxonomy on Anomalies}\nSome previous literature considers anomalies types to be three-fold: point anomalies, conditional or contextural anomalies, and group or collective anomalies~.\nIn this survey, we mainly focus on point anomalies detection for its popularity in practical applications and its adequacy to elucidate the similarities and differences between sub-tasks.\nDetails of the other two kinds of anomalies, \\ie contextural anomalies that often occur in time-series tasks, and collective anomalies that are common in the data mining field, are not covered in this survey. We recommend readers to the recent AD survey papers~ for an in-depth discussion on them.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Remark: Taxonomy based on Supervision}\nWe use sensory/semantic dichotomy to subdivide AD at the task level. From the perspective of methodologies, some literature categorizes AD techniques into unsupervised and (semi-) supervised settings.

OOD detection also concerns the performance of ID classification.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Remark: OSR \\vs OOD Detection}\nThe difference between OSR and OOD detection tasks is three-fold.\n\\noindent\\textbf{1) Different benchmark setup:} OSR benchmarks usually split one multi-class classification dataset into ID and OOD parts according to classes, while OOD detection takes one dataset as ID and finds several other datasets as OOD with the guarantee of non-overlapping categories between ID/OOD datasets. \nHowever, despite the different benchmark traditions of the two sub-tasks, they are in fact tackling the same problem of semantic shift detection.\n\\noindent\\textbf{2) No additional data in OSR:} Due to the requirement of theoretical open-risk bound guarantee, OSR discourages the usage of additional data during training by design~. This restriction precludes methods that are more focused on effective performance improvements (\\eg outlier exposures~) but may violate OSR constraints.\n\\noindent\\textbf{3) Broadness of OOD detection:} Compare to OSR, OOD detection encompasses a broader spectrum of learning tasks (\\eg multi-label classification~), wider solution space (to be discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:ood}).\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Remark: Mainstream OOD Detection Focuses on Semantics}\nWhile most works in the current community interpret the keyword ``out-of-distribution'' as ``out-of-label/semantic-distribution'', some OOD detection works also consider detecting covariate shifts~, which claim that covariate shift usually leads to a significant drop in model performance and therefore needs to be identified and rejected.\nHowever, although detecting covariate shift is reasonable on some specific tasks (usually due to high-risk or privacy reasons) that are to be discussed in the following paragraph, research on this topic remains a controversial task \\emph{w.r.t} OOD generalization tasks (\\cf Section~\\ref{sec:related_topics} and Section~\\ref{sec:future_direction}). Detecting semantic shift has been the mainstream of OOD detection tasks.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Remark: To Generalize, or To Detect?}\nWe provide another definition from the perspective of generalization:\nOut-of-distribution detection, or OOD detection, aims to detect test samples to which the model cannot or does not want to generalize~.\nIn most of the machine learning tasks, such as image classification, the models are expected to generalize their prediction capability to samples with covariate shift, and they are only unable to generalize when semantic shift occurs.\nHowever, for applications where models are by-design nontransferable to other domain, such as many deep reinforcement learning tasks like game AI~, the key term ``distribution'' should refer to ``data/input distribution'', so that the model should refuse to decide the environment that is not the same as the training environment, \\ie $P(X)\\neq P'(X)$. \nSimilar applications are those high-risk tasks such as medical image classification~ or in privacy-sensitive scenario~, where the models are expected to be very conservative and only make predictions for samples exactly from the training distribution, rejecting any samples that deviate from it.\nRecent studies~ also highlight a model-specific view: a robust model should generalize to examples with covariate shift; a weak model should reject them.\nUltimately, an OOD detection task is considered valid when it successfully balances the aspects of ``detection\" and ``generalization\", taking into account factors such as meaningfulness and the inherent challenges presented by the task. Nonetheless, detecting semantic shift remains the primary focus of OOD detection tasks and is central to this survey.", "cites": [3216, 1629, 3219, 7130, 3218, 3217, 1624, 7129], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5714285714285714, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes concepts from multiple papers to provide a coherent framework of OOD detection, including its relation to OSR, AD, and ND.

Since outlier detection does not follow the train-test procedure but has access to all observations, approaches to this problem are usually transductive rather than inductive~.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Definition}\nOutlier detection aims to detect samples that are markedly different from the others in the given observation set, due to either covariate or semantic shift.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Position in Framework}\nDifferent from all previous sub-tasks, whose in-distribution is defined during training, the ``in-distribution'' for outlier detection refers to the majority of the observations. Outliers may exist due to semantic shift on $P(Y)$, or covariate shift on $P(X)$.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Application and Benchmark}\nWhile mostly applied in data mining tasks~, outlier detection is also used in real-world computer vision applications such as video surveillance~ and dataset cleaning~.\nFor the application of dataset cleaning, outlier detection is usually used as a pre-processing step for the main tasks such as learning from open-set noisy labels~, webly supervised learning~, and open-set semi-supervised learning~.\nTo construct an outlier detection benchmark on MNIST, one class should be chosen so that all samples that belong to this class are considered as inliers. A small fraction of samples from other classes are introduced as outliers to be detected. \n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Evaluation}\nApart from F-scores, AUROC, and AUPR, the evaluation of outlier detectors can be also evaluated by the performance of the main task it supports. For example, if an outlier detector is used to purify a dataset with noisy labels, the performance of a classifier that is trained on the cleaned dataset can indicate the quality of the outlier detector.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Remark: On Inclusion of Outlier Detection} \nInterestingly, the outlier detection task can be considered as an outlier in the generalized OOD detection framework, since outlier detectors are operated on the scenario when all observations are given, rather than following the training-test scheme. Also, publications exactly on this topic are rarely seen in the recent deep learning venues. However, we still include outlier detection in our framework, because intuitively speaking, outliers also belong to one type of out-of-distribution, and introducing it can help familiarize readers more with various terms~(\\eg OD, AD, ND, OOD) that have confused the community for a long while.", "cites": [8630, 2277, 7702, 71, 3220], "cite_extract_rate": 0.35714285714285715, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a clear definition and contextual placement of outlier detection within the generalized OOD framework, synthesizing the concept with related tasks like AD, ND, and OSR.

Despite methodologies differences, subsequent works developed on OOD detection and OSR share the underlying spirit of classification with the rejection option. \n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Domain Adaptation/Generalization}\nDomain Adaptation (DA)~ and Domain Generalization (DG)~ also follow ``open-world'' assumption. Different from generalized OOD detection settings, DA/DG expects the existence of covariate shift during testing without any semantic shift and requires classifiers to make accurate predictions into the same set of classes~.\nNoticing that OOD detection commonly concerns detecting the semantic shift, which is complementary to DA/DG. In the case when both covariate and semantic shift take place, the model should be able to detect semantic shift while being robust to covariate shift. More discussion on relations between DA/DG and OOD detection is in Section~\\ref{sec:future_direction}. \nThe difference between DA and DG is that while the former requires extra but few training samples from the target domain, the latter does not.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Novelty Discovery} \nNovelty discovery~ requires all observations to be given in advance as outlier detection does. The observations are provided in a semi-supervised manner, and the goal is to explore and discover the new categories and classes in the unlabeled set. Different from outlier detection where outliers are sparse, the unlabeled set in novelty discovery setting can mostly consist of, and even be overwhelmed by unknown classes.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Zero-shot Learning}\nZero-shot learning~ has a similar goal of novelty discovery but follows the training-testing scheme. The test set is under the ``open-world'' assumption with unknown classes, which expects classifiers trained only on the known classes to perform classification on unknown testing samples with the help of extra information such as label relationships.\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Open-world Recognition}\nOpen-world recognition~ aims to build a lifelong learning machine that can actively detect novel images~, label them as new classes, and perform continuous learning. It can be viewed as a combination of novelty detection (or open-set recognition) and incremental learning. \n\\revise{More specifically, open-world recognition extends the concept of OSR by adding the ability to incrementally learn new classes over time. In open-world scenarios, the system not only identifies unknown instances but also can update its model to include these new classes as part of the known set. This approach is more dynamic and suited for real-world applications where the environment is not static, and new categories can emerge after the initial training phase~.}\n\\smallskip\n\\keypoint{Conformal Prediction}\n\\revise{Conformal prediction (CP) stands as a robust statistical framework in machine learning, primarily designed to provide confidence measures for predictions~. Distinctively, it yields prediction intervals with specified confidence levels, transcending the limitations of mere point estimates.\nIn scenarios of OOD detection, the conformal prediction framework becomes particularly insightful: wider prediction intervals or lower confidence levels generated by conformal prediction methods can serve as indicators of such OOD data.\nAlthough research at the intersection of CP and OOD detection is still emerging~, the potential of applying the conformal prediction framework in this domain is significant and warrants further exploration.}", "cites": [3221, 8632, 7131, 3228, 8631, 3225, 3226, 7057, 3230, 3223, 328, 3229, 3224, 3227, 3222], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6818181818181818, "origin_cites_number": 22, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes related topics by connecting them to generalized OOD detection, highlighting distinctions and commonalities between concepts such as open-world recognition and conformal prediction.

The property can be important for the adoption of OOD detection methods in real-world production environments, where the overhead cost of retraining can be prohibitive. Early work ODIN~ is a post-hoc method that uses temperature scaling and input perturbation to amplify the ID/OOD separability. Key to the method, a sufficiently large temperature has a strong smoothing effect that transforms the softmax score back to the logit space---which effectively distinguishes ID vs. OOD. Note that this is different from confidence calibration, where a much milder $T$ is employed. While calibration focuses on representing the true correctness likelihood of {ID data only}, the ODIN score is designed to maximize the gap between ID and OOD data and may no longer be meaningful from a predictive confidence standpoint. \nBuilt on the insights, recent work~ proposed using an energy score for OOD detection, which enjoys theoretical interpretation from a likelihood perspective~. Test samples with lower energy are considered ID and vice versa. \nJointEnergy score~ is then proposed to perform OOD detection for multi-label classification networks. The most recent work SHE~ uses stored patterns that represent classes to measure the discrepancy of unseen data for OOD detection, which is hyperparameter-free and computationally efficient compared to classic energy methods.\nTechniques such as layer-wise Mahalanobis distance~ and Gram Matrix~ are implemented for better-hidden feature quality to perform density estimation.\nRecently, one fundamental cause of the overconfidence issue on OOD data has been revealed that using mismatched BatchNorm statistics---that are estimated on ID data yet blindly applied to the OOD data in testing---can trigger abnormally high unit activations and model output accordingly~. Therefore, ReAct~ proposes truncating the high activations, which establishes strong post-hoc detection performance and further boosts the performance of existing scoring functions. \nSimilarly, NMD~ uses the activation means from BatchNorm layers for ID/OOD discrepancy.\nWhile {ReAct} considers activation space,  proposes a weight sparsification-based OOD detection framework termed DICE. DICE ranks weights based on a measure of contribution and selectively uses the most salient weights to derive the output for OOD detection. By pruning away noisy signals, DICE provably reduces the output variance for OOD data, resulting in a sharper output distribution and stronger separability from ID data. \n\\revise{In a similar vein, ASH~ also targets the activation space but adopts a different strategy. It removes a significant portion (e.g., 90\\%) of an input's feature representations from a late layer based on a top-K criterion, followed by adjusting the remaining activations (e.g., 10\\%) either by scaling or assigning constant values, yielding surprisingly effective results.}\n\\keypoint{b.~Training-based Methods}\nWith the training phase, confidence can be developed via designing a confidence-estimating branch~ or class~, ensembling with leaving-out strategy~, adversarial training~, stronger data augmentation~, pretext training~, better uncertainty modeling~, input-level manipulation~, and utilizing feature or statistics from the intermediate-layer features~. Especially, to enhance the sensitivity to covariate shift, some methods focus on the hidden representations in the middle layers of neural networks. Generalized ODIN, or G-ODIN~ extended ODIN~ by using a specialized training objective termed DeConf-C and choosing hyperparameters such as perturbation magnitude on ID data. Note that we do not categorize G-ODIN as post-hoc method as it requires model retraining. Recent work~ shows that the overconfidence issue can be mitigated through Logit Normalization (LogitNorm), a simple fix to the common cross-entropy loss by enforcing a constant vector norm on the logits in training. Trained with LogitNorm, neural networks produce highly distinguishable confidence scores between in- and out-of-distribution data.\nSome works redesign the label space to achieve good OOD detection performance. While commonly used to encode categorical information for classification, the one-hot encoding ignores the inherent relationship among labels. For example, it is unreasonable to have a uniform distance between \\texttt{dog} and \\texttt{cat} vs. \\texttt{dog} and \\texttt{car}.\nTo this end, several works attempt to use information in the label space for OOD detection.\nSome works arrange the large semantic space into a hierarchical taxonomy of known classes~.\nUnder the redesigned label architecture, top-down classification strategy~ and group softmax training~ are demonstrated effective. \nAnother set of works uses word embeddings to automatically construct the label space.\nIn , the sparse one-hot labels are replaced with several dense word embeddings from different NLP models, forming multiple regression heads for robust training. When testing, the label, which has the minimal distance to all the embedding vectors from different heads, will be considered as the prediction. If the minimal distance crosses above the threshold, the sample would be classified as ``novel''.\nRecent works further take the image features from language-image pre-training models~ to better detect novel classes, where the image encoding space also contains rich information from the language space~.", "cites": [8319, 3291, 3249, 7132, 3281, 3246, 3256, 7130, 3295, 3296, 3237, 3293, 3248, 7705, 3239, 3262, 3254, 3290, 3265, 107, 3260, 3277, 7707, 3274, 3242, 3267, 3285, 1639, 3255, 7494, 3251, 3276], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8421052631578947, "origin_cites_number": 38, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.2, "critical": 3.3, "abstraction": 3.8}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by connecting multiple post-hoc and training-based methods into a structured overview, emphasizing their design choices and effectiveness.

Another straightforward approach with outlier exposure spares an extra abstention (or rejection class) and considers all the given OOD samples in this class~.\nA later work OECC~ noticed that an extra regularization for confidence calibration introduces additional improvement for OE.\nTo effectively utilize the given, usually massive, OOD samples, some work use outlier mining~ and adversarial resampling~ approaches to obtain a compact yet representative set.\n\\revise{In cases where the meaningful ``near''-OOD images are not available, MixOE  proposes to interpolate between ID and ``far''-OOD images to obtain informative outliers for better regularization.} \nOther works consider a more practical scenario where given OOD samples contain ID samples, therefore using pseudo-labeling~ or ID filtering methods~ with optimal transport scheme~ to reduce the interference of ID data.\nIn general, OOD detection with outlier exposure can reach a much better performance. \nHowever, research shows that the performance can be largely affected by the correlations between given and real OOD samples~. To address the issue, recent work~ proposes a novel framework that enables effectively exploiting unlabeled in-the-wild data for OOD detection. Unlabeled wild data is frequently available since it is produced essentially for free whenever deploying an existing classifier in a real-world system. This setting can be viewed as training OOD detectors in their \\emph{natural habitats}, which provide a much better match to the true test time distribution than data collected offline.\n\\keypoint{b.~Outlier Data Generation}\nThe outlier exposure approaches impose a strong assumption on the availability of OOD training data, which can be infeasible in practice. \nWhen no OOD sample is available, some methods attempt to synthesize OOD samples to enable ID/OOD separability.\nExisting works leverage GANs to generate OOD training samples and force the model predictions to be uniform~, generate boundary samples in the low-density region~, or similarly, high-confidence OOD samples~, or using meta-learning the update sample generation~.\nHowever, synthesizing images in the high-dimensional pixel space can be difficult to\noptimize. \nRecent work VOS~ proposed synthesizing virtual outliers from the low-likelihood region in the feature space, which is more tractable given lower dimensionality. \nWhile VOS~ is a parametric approach that models the feature space as a class-conditional Gaussian distribution, NPOS~ also generates outlier ID data but in a non-parametric approach. \\revise{Noticing the generated OOD data could be incorrect or irrelevant, DOE~ synthesizes hard OOD data that leads to worst judgments to train the OOD detector with a min-max learning scheme, and ATOL~ uses auxiliary task to relieve the mistaken OOD generation.}\nIn object detection,  proposes synthesizing unknown objects from videos in the wild using spatial-temporal unknown distillation.", "cites": [3219, 3269, 3299, 3214, 3294, 3280, 3234, 6982, 3245, 8637, 6981, 3258, 3238, 3216, 3264, 3241, 3244, 3271, 1630], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8260869565217391, "origin_cites_number": 23, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple outlier exposure methods, connecting them under the broader theme of using real or synthetic outliers to improve OOD detection.

The mainstream OOD detection works primarily focus on detecting semantic shifts.\nAdmittedly, the field of OOD detection can be very broad due to the diverse nature of distribution shifts. \nSuch a broad OOD definition also leads to some challenges and concerns~, which advocate a clear specification of OOD type in consideration (\\eg semantic OOD, adversarial OOD, \\etc) so that proposed solutions can be more specialized.\nBesides, the motivation of detecting a certain distribution shift also requires clarification. While rejecting classifying samples with semantic shift is apparent, detecting sensory OOD should be specified to some meaningful scenarios to contextualize the necessity and practical relevance of the task. \nWe also urge the community to carefully construct the benchmarks and evaluations. It is noticed that early work~ ignored the fact that some OOD datasets may contain images with ID categories, causing inaccurate performance evaluation. \nFortunately, recent OOD detection works~\nhave realized this flaw and pay special attention to removing ID classes from OOD samples to ensure proper evaluation. \n\\keypoint{b.~Outlier-free OOD Detection}\nThe outlier exposure approach~ imposes a strong assumption of the availability of  OOD  training data,  which can be difficult to obtain in practice. Moreover, one needs to perform careful de-duplication to ensure that the outlier training data does not contain ID data. These restrictions may lead to inflexible solutions and prevent the adoption of methods in the real world. Going forward, a major challenge for the field is to devise outlier-free learning objectives that are less dependent on auxiliary outlier dataset. \n\\keypoint{c.~Tradeoff Between Classification and OOD Detection}\nIn OSR and OOD detection, it is important to achieve the dual objectives simultaneously: one for the ID task (\\eg image classification), another for the OOD detection task. For a shared network, an inherent trade-off may exist between the two tasks. Promising solutions should strive for both. These two tasks may or may not contradict each other, depending on the methodologies. For example, ~ advocated the integration of image classification and open-set recognition so that the model will possess the capability of discriminative recognition on known classes and sensitivity to novel classes at the same time.\n~ also showed that the ability of detecting novel classes can be highly correlated with its accuracy on the closed-set classes.\n~ demonstrated that optimizing for the cluster compactness of ID classes may facilitate both improved classification and distance-based OOD detection performance. Such solutions may be more desirable than ND, which develops a binary OOD detector separately from the classification model, and requires deploying two models. \n\\keypoint{d.~Real-world Benchmarks and Evaluations}\nCurrent methods in OOD detection are predominantly evaluated on smaller datasets like CIFAR. However, it has been observed that strategies effective on CIFAR may not perform as well on larger datasets like ImageNet, which has a more extensive semantic space. This discrepancy underscores the importance of conducting OOD detection evaluations in large-scale, real-world settings. Consequently, we recommend future research to focus on benchmarks based on ImageNet for OOD detection~ and to explore large-scale Open Set Recognition (OSR) benchmarks~ to fully test the effectiveness of these methods. \\revise{Additionally, recent research~ highlights the presence of erroneous samples in ImageNet OOD benchmarks and introduces the corrected NINCO dataset for more accurate evaluations.

This setting explicitly promotes the generalization ability of OOD detectors.\nRecent works on open long-tailed recognition~, open compound domain adaptation~, open-set domain adaptation~ and open-set domain generalization~ consider the potential existence of open-class samples.\nLooking ahead, we envision great research opportunities on how OOD detection and OOD generalization can better enable each other~, in terms of both algorithmic design and comprehensive performance evaluation.\n\\keypoint{c.~OOD Detection \\& Open-Set Noisy Labels}\nExisting methods of learning from open-set noisy labels focus on suppressing the negative effects of noise~. However,\nthe open-set noisy samples can be useful for outlier exposure (\\cf ~Section \\ref{sec:ood_classification_oe})~ and potentially benefit OOD detection.\nWith a similar idea, the setting of open-set semi-supervised learning can be promising for OOD detection.\nWe believe the combination of OOD detection and the previous two fields can provide more insights and possibilities.\n\\keypoint{d.~OOD Detection For Broader Learning Tasks}\nAs mentioned in Section~\\ref{sec:ood_discussion}, OOD detection encompasses a broader spectrum of learning tasks, including multi-label classification~, object detection~, image segmentation~, time-series prediction~, and LiDAR-based 3D object detection~.\nFor the classification task itself, the researchers also extended the OOD detection technique to improve the reliability of zero-shot pretrained models~ (\\eg CLIP).\nFurthermore, some studies focus on applying OOD detection methods to produce reliable image captions~. \n\\revise{Recent advancements extend OOD detection to continuously adaptive or online learning environments~. Additionally, OOD detection shows promise in addressing model reliability issues in broader applications, like mitigating hallucination problems in large language models~. The integration of OOD detection methods promises to enhance the reliability and practicality of models across various fields, and insights from these fields could, in turn, further refine OOD detection techniques.}\n\\keypoint{e.~OOD Detection with World Models}\n\\revise{The existing works utilizing foundation models, particularly multi-modal ones such as CLIP~, have significantly enhanced OOD detection performance, as discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:ood_foundation}.\nStarting from this, recent advancements have further focused on leveraging the extensive world knowledge encapsulated in Large Language Models~. This approach aligns with the rapid development in multi-modal world models~, presenting burgeoning opportunities for further innovation within the OOD detection community.\n}", "cites": [7708, 1629, 8630, 3350, 3246, 6982, 3225, 2232, 3343, 2344, 6981, 2238, 3352, 2237, 3349, 3351, 3347, 3348, 1639, 3229, 2711, 3222, 1630], "cite_extract_rate": 0.92, "origin_cites_number": 25, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple cited papers to highlight how OOD detection intersects with related sub-tasks, noisy labels, and broader learning tasks, creating a coherent narrative.
