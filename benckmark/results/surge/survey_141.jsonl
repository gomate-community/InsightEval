The ability of deep neural networks to act as good function approximators has enabled them to successfully solve tasks such as image classification~, object detection~, instance segmentation~, language modeling~, speech generation~, human pose estimation~, etc. Due to this widespread use of deep learning techniques, the efficiency and reliability of these techniques become equally important when they are deployed in the real world. Many of these applications are crucial, requiring special focus on the safety and security of such systems~.\nRecent studies have shown that deep learning models are susceptible to some carefully constructed small noise called \\textit{adversarial perturbations}, which when added to an input image, cause the network output to change drastically without making perceptible changes to the input image~. Such perturbations pose a severe threat to the real-world application of any neural network model, especially in scenarios of autonomous vehicles and facial verification systems. Studies have shown that if an attacker has access to the model which needs to be attacked (i.e., the target model) along with access to only a few images from the distribution of images using which the target model has been trained, then they might achieve very high fooling rates (see \\autoref{subsec:terminology}) on the entire distribution of images in the target dataset~.\nSeveral techniques have been proposed to generate adversarial examples. While some of these approaches~ focus on maximizing the loss function of the target model by changing the input in the opposite direction of its gradients, i.e., by using gradient ascent, others~ modify the input using a surrogate objective function that causes the target model to misclassify the modified image. For all of these techniques, the perturbations generated are different for different images, i.e., a separate optimization has to be performed for each image to generate an adversarially perturbed image. This kind of generation of adversarial perturbations is hence called \\textit{per-instance generation}.\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/UAP_original.pdf}\n   \\caption{When the same perturbation (center) is added to clean images on the left, it causes misclassification of images generated on the right~. Note that the change on the clean images (left) after adding the perturbation are imperceptible.}\n\\label{fig:uap_main_illustration}\n\\end{figure}\nWhile per-instance adversarial perturbation varies for different samples in a dataset, there exist \\textit{image-agnostic perturbations} (see \\autoref{subsec:terminology}) called \\textit{universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs)} as introduced by Moosavi-Dezfooli \\etal~ that can fool state-of-the-art (SOTA) recognition models on most natural images with high probability and are quasi-imperceptible, i.e., not visible to the naked eye (see \\textbf{\\autoref{fig:uap_main_illustration}}). Since we need to compute only a single perturbation vector to fool all the images, they are much more efficient in terms of computation time and cost when compared to per-instance adversarial attacks. Generally, the $\\ell_p$ norm of the perturbation is kept small to make it quasi-imperceptible. Furthermore, UAPs generalize well across different architectures, exhibiting excellent transferability and fooling rates on models other than the target model. Since~, many methods have been introduced by researchers to generate UAPs, both \\textit{data-driven} and \\textit{data-independent} (see \\autoref{subsec:terminology}).~ introduced a method to generate UAPs using Universal Adversarial Networks (UANs), leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).~ introduced a data-independent approach to generate UAPs by adulterating the features extracted at multiple different layers of the network. Their approach of crafting perturbations did not utilize any knowledge about the data distribution using which the target model has been trained.~ introduced a data-driven approach utilizing fooling and diversity loss along with a generative model to create UAPs.~ extended~ by introducing a two-stage process to create adversaries using class impressions without using any data. Several other works~ have also introduced methods to create adversarial attacks.\nUAPs being image-agnostic can misclassify any unseen image, making deep neural networks vulnerable to attacks. Defense mechanisms are hence required to prevent such attacks.~ introduced the Perturbation Rectifying Network (PRN) to defend against UAPs.~ proposed a method to increase the robustness of a model against UAPs by training with perturbed images using min-max optimization.~ extended the previous approach~ by introducing a shared training procedure for defense against universal adversarial perturbation.~ analyzed the robustness of neural network models against UAPs with varying degrees of shape and texture-based training. \n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/Vertical_timeline_with_type_cropped.png}\n    \\caption{The above timeline shows the year of publication of various attack and defense methods mentioned in this survey.

However, in the case of a universal adversarial perturbation, we want only \\textit{one} such $\\delta$ to be able to fool $f$ for \\textit{all} the data points available in $X$. This means that our objective while generating a universal perturbation is to find such a $\\delta$, which upon adding to all the data points $x$ in $X$, makes them cross the decision boundary nearest to them (see \\textbf{\\autoref{fig:uap_explanation}}).\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n    \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/uap_illust_algo.pdf}\n   \\caption{In this illustration, data points $x1$, $x2$ and $x3$ are super-imposed, and the classification regions $\\mathscr{R}_i$ (i.e., regions of constant estimated label) are shown in different colors.

Also, to avoid working with extreme values ($\\approx 0$), the logarithm of the product is used as the loss function. It is also worth noting that activations are considered after the non-linearity (typically ReLU). Therefore $\\bar{f^i}$ is non-negative, and it is empirically suggested to restrict optimization at convolution layers.\nFinally, convergence is understood when either the loss gets saturated or the fooling performance over a small held outset is maximized.

While  requires a large amount of data in $X_d$ for perturbation generation,  has shown that by using only 64 images in $X_d$ fooling rates as high as 60\\% can be achieved. Since data-independent techniques do not consume any data points from the distribution $X$, these techniques converge much quicker than their data-driven counterparts but at the cost of lower fooling rates. \nSome of the techniques produce only a single universal adversarial perturbation as in , while others produce a whole distribution of universal adversarial perturbations~. Although a single universal adversarial perturbation is sufficiently capable of fooling a target model, learning a whole distribution of perturbations helps us to understand and analyze the behavior of these perturbations, and hence propose better defense techniques against them.\nAlthough the term \\textit{universal} in universal adversarial perturbation stands for the universality of the perturbation within the same data distribution $X$ using which the target model has been trained (i.e., the same perturbation can be used for all images in $X$ to fool the target network model), the perturbations produced by almost all the techniques introduced in the previous sections show excellent \\textit{transferability} in fooling neural networks other than the target model~. Additionally, it has also been shown that the same perturbation generated for a target model can be used to misclassify images from a data distribution thats different from the target data distribution. The decrease in the fooling rate on images not in the target data distribution is significant in the case of data-driven techniques as compared to data-independent techniques~.", "cites": [4719, 4721, 4716, 975, 8184], "cite_extract_rate": 0.625, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "comparative", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic comparison of attack techniques for universal adversarial perturbations by synthesizing information from cited papers, particularly distinguishing between data-driven and data-free methods.

The primary purpose of the PRN is to restore the perturbed image to the original image, i.e., to subtract the perturbation from the perturbed image. So in case a perturbation is present (checked via a binary classifier called the \\textit{Detector Network}), a rectified image is passed to the classifier network, else the original image is passed to the classifier network which classifies the input image.

Then, to defend against these attacks, it proposes two methods of universal adversarial training. The first one models the training process as a two-player min-max game where the minimization is over the target model parameters, and the maximization is over the universal adversarial perturbation. The second method further improves the defense efficiency by providing a `low-cost' algorithm with a slight decrease in robustness, but reducing the training time by half as compared to the previous one.\nDifferent from Moosavi-Dezfooli \\etal~, this paper proposed a stochastic gradient-based optimization for a $\\beta$-clipped loss function,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\max_{\\delta}  \\mathscr{L}(w, \\delta) =  \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat l(w, x_i + \\delta) \\text{, s.t. } \\| \\delta \\|_p \\leq \\xi \\label{eq:univ_prob}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\hat l(w, x_i + \\delta) = \\text{min}\\{ l(w, x_i + \\delta) , \\, \\beta\\}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $l(w, \\cdot)$ represents the loss used for training DNNs, $w$ represents the target model weights, $X=\\{x_i; i=1,\\ldots,N\\}$ represents training samples, $\\delta$ represents universal perturbation, and $\\beta$ is hyperparameter used to clip the unbounded cross-entropy loss.\nThe above optimization problem can be solved by a stochastic gradient method, where each iteration is based on a minibatch of samples instead of one instance. This accelerates computation on a GPU, and requires a simple gradient update instead of the complex DeepFool~ inner loop, resulting in fast convergence of the proposed method.\n\\textbf{Universal adversarial training} formulates the problem of training robust classifiers as a min-max optimization problem.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\min_{w} \\max_{\\|\\delta\\|_{p} \\leq \\epsilon}  (w,\\delta) =  \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} l(w, x_{i} + \\delta)\n\\label{eq:adv_univ}\n\\end{equation}\nPreviously, solving this optimization problem directly\nwas deemed computationally infeasible due to the substantial cost\nassociated with generating a universal adversarial perturbation~, but the authors show that unlike Madry \\etal~, updating the universal adversarial perturbation using a simple step is sufficient for building universally robust networks.\n\\begin{algorithm}\n    \\caption{Alternating stochastic gradient method for adversarial training against universal perturbation~}\n    \\label{alg:univ_adv_training}\n    \\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n        \\State \\textbf{input}: Training samples $X$, perturbation bound $\\epsilon$, learning rate $\\tau$, momentum $\\mu$\n        \\For{epoch $= 1 \\ldots N_{ep}$}\n        \\For{minibatch $B\\subset X$}\n        \\State Update $w$ with momentum stochastic gradient descent;\n        \\State \\qquad  $g_w \\gets  \\mu g_w  - \\mathbb{}_{x \\in B} [\\nabla_w \\, l(w, x + \\delta)]$\n        \\State \\qquad  $w \\gets w + \\tau g_w$ \n        \\State Update $\\delta$ with  stochastic gradient ascent;\n        \\State \\qquad $\\delta \\gets \\delta + \\epsilon \\, \\text{sign}(\\mathbb{}_{x \\in B} [\\nabla_{\\delta} \\, l(w, x + \\delta)])$ \n        \\State Project $\\delta$ to $\\ell_p$ ball.\n        \\EndFor\n        \\EndFor\n    \\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nAs in \\textbf{\\autoref{alg:univ_adv_training}}, each iteration alternatively updates the target model weights $w$ using gradient descent, and then updates the universal adversarial perturbation $\\delta$ using gradient ascent, only once per step, and these updates accumulate for both $w$ and $\\delta$ through training.\n\\textbf{Low-cost Universal adversarial training:}\nAs UAPs are image-agnostic, so the results of the updating target model parameters and updating perturbation $\\delta$ should be invariant to their order of change in one iteration.

Various applications rely on semantic segmentation, whether it is route navigation for autonomous cars, robot vision, or portrait mode of a smartphone. Before diving into how adversarial attacks for semantic segmentation are generated, it is important to exemplify the fooling in semantic segmentation. There exist adversarial perturbations that cause the model to output the same segmentation map for different arbitrary inputs. The attacker could also target removing a specific class, leaving the rest of the segmentation map unchanged~. As seen in \\textbf{\\autoref{fig:segmen_pedestrians_uap}}, adding the perturbation hides a specific class (pedestrian in this case) from the target segmentation map. This type of attack poses a severe threat to the real-world application of semantic segmentation in autonomous cars, robotics, or other computer vision-related tasks. Adversarial attacks for segmentation tasks are quite similar to the classification task. While the fooling rate for an image classification task is well defined, it is unclear for other tasks like segmentation. Therefore a task-independent `Generalized Fooling Rate (GFR)' is introduced here,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eq:GFR}\n    GFR(M) = \\frac{R - M(\\hat{y}_{\\delta}, \\hat{y})}{R}\n\\end{equation}\nHere $M$ is the metric for measuring the performance of a model for any given task, $\\hat{y}$ is the clean image output, $\\hat{y}_{\\delta}$ is the perturbed image output, and $R$ is the range of $M$.\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\centering\n\\noindent\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{minipage}{.22\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/segmentation/pascal_small_fcn_alexnet_with_data_sat_diff_reg_0.png}\\\n    FCN-Alex\n  \\end{minipage}\n   \\begin{minipage}{.22\\textwidth}\n       \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/segmentation/pascal_small_fcn8s_vgg16_with_data_sat_diff_reg_0.png}\\\n    {\\small FCN-8s-VGG}\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.22\\textwidth}\n   \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/segmentation/pascal_small_vgg16_with_data_sat_diff_reg_0.png}\\\n    DL-VGG\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.22\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/segmentation/pascal_small_resnet_msc_with_data_sat_diff_reg_0.png}\\\n    DL-RN101\n  \\end{minipage}\n    \\vspace{0.002\\textwidth}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\vspace{.01cm}\n\\caption{UAPs crafted by GD-UAP (see \\autoref{algo:gd_uap}) for semantic segmentation with initial prior as 'data with less BG.'}\n\\label{fig:data-free-sample-perturbations-segmentation}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\noindent\\begin{minipage}{\\columnwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{minipage}{.20\\linewidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_fcn_alexnet_im.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n   \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n       \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_fcn8s_vgg16_im.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_resnet_msc_im.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_vgg16_im.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\vspace{0.002\\textwidth}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\noindent\\begin{minipage}{\\columnwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_fcn_alexnet_output.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n   \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n       \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_fcn8s_vgg16_output.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_resnet_msc_output.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_vgg16_output.png}\\\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\vspace{0.004\\textwidth}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\noindent\\begin{minipage}{\\columnwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{minipage}{.20\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_fcn_alexnet_pert.png}\\\n    FCN\\\\Alex\n  \\end{minipage}\n   \\begin{minipage}{.2\\textwidth}\n   \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_fcn8s_vgg16_pert.png}\\\n    FCN-8S\\\\VGG\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.2\\textwidth}\n      \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_resnet_msc_pert.png}\\\n    DL\\\\RN101\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\begin{minipage}{.2\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/segmentation/2007_009413_vgg16_pert.png}\\\n    DL\\\\VGG\n  \\end{minipage}\n    \\vspace{0.002\\textwidth}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\vspace{0.1cm}\n\\caption{Semantic segmentation output with initial prior as 'data with less BG' for different models.

It also assists the attacker in determining the performance of the perturbation in terms of the damage caused to a model with respect to a metric.\nSemantic segmentation models are trained to perform pixel-level classification into $n$ categories, including the background. Performance is generally measured through mean Intersection over Union (IoU) computed between the predicted and ground truth segmentation map. Extension of UAPs~ directly for this task is non-trivial.~ showed that their algorithm for the generation of UAPs could be directly applied for this task without any changes. The authors reported their results on the PASCAL-VOC 2012~ dataset. Since this dataset had the background pixels percentage greater than half, the authors created a smaller training dataset with a lower background pixels percentage and named it as 'data with less BG'. The perturbation created with this data has a higher capability of fooling or an increased Generalized Fooling Rate for mean IoU (GFR(mIoU)).\nAs seen in \\textbf{\\autoref{fig:data-free-sample-perturbations-segmentation}}, perturbations learned for the task of semantic segmentation for different models look different across architectures, similar to object recognition. For the same input image, perturbations learned by different models produce very different outputs even when their clean image output looks similar, as can be noted from \\textbf{\\autoref{fig:multiple-nets-segmentation}}.\nMetzen \\etal proposed a novel approach to generate UAPs specifically for semantic segmentation. They introduced two methods, one to make the target model output a fixed segmentation map, and the other to remove one class from the target model output. They further show that on passing the generated UAPs (in case of a fixed target segmentation map) through the target model, the output looks similar to the target scene itself.\n~ proposed shared adversarial training for training robust models against universal adversarial perturbations for the semantic segmentation task.

Li \\etal was the first to propose a universal adversarial attack against image retrieval systems (see \\textbf{\\autoref{fig:img_retrieval}}). Concretely, image retrieval attacks are to make the retrieval system return irrelevant images to the query at the top of the ranking list. Extensive efforts have been made to improve search accuracy, but very little work has been done around the vulnerability of state-of-the-art image retrieval systems. Although retrieval systems use CNNs as the feature extractor, it is still challenging to apply existing UAPs generation techniques in image retrieval directly because of several reasons, namely (i) different dataset label formats, (ii) different goals, (iii) different sizes of model input, and (iv) different model output and optimization methods, as explained in .\nA novel universal adversarial perturbation attack method for image retrieval is proposed in~, tackling the above challenges. A neural network generates a UAP, which, when used to slightly alter the query along with randomized resizing of images and UAPs, breaks the neighborhood relationships among image feature points, causing degradation in the corresponding ranking metric. Image retrieval can be viewed as a ranking problem, from which perspective the relationship between query and references plays an important role.
