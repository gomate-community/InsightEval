The existing approaches can be classed as either \\emph{node-link} diagrams, \\emph{timeline-based} techniques, or \\emph{matrix-based} approaches.\n\t\\textbf{Scalability}\n\tThe supported data-set sizes and, accordingly, the scalability of the approaches (nodes and hyperedges) present a significant factor.\n\tDiving the capabilities of existing approaches in five distinguishable groups, we distinguish between very low scalability (\\symVeryLow, less than ten nodes or hyperedges), low scalability (\\symLow, between 10 and 50), medium scalability (\\symMedium, between 50 to 200), high scalability (\\symHigh, between 200 and 1000), and very high scalability (\\symVeryHigh, more than 1000).\n\tEspecially node-link-diagrams with too many connections are prone to clutter.\n\tMany basic representations are only applicable to few vertices and hyperedges, whereas different techniques perform better.\n\t\\textbf{Static vs. Dynamic}\n\tThis criterion is concerned with the support of dynamic (i.e., temporal) data (\\symYes) in contrast to static data (\\symNo).\n\tAnalyzing trends requires different time steps to be comparable in the visualization.\n\tThe methods range from a simple timeline to a direct comparison of single components by highlighting different stages.\n\tNevertheless, approaches supporting dynamic hypergraphs are still limited and only recently began to emerge.\n\t\\textbf{Interactivity}\n\tThis criterion describes the support of interactivity (\\symYes) by visualizations compared to a static, not modifiable (\\symNo) visualization.\n\tIt describes the ability to modify the model or the resulting representation for analysis purposes.\n\tBesides highlighting, sorting or filtering can enable the analysis of larger graphs.\n\tFor example, even Venn diagrams would benefit from interactivity to reduce ambiguities. \n\tOther visualization methods may depend on a multi-level structure to represent the entire hypergraph coherently.\n\t\\textbf{Tasks \\& Use Cases}\n\tThis criterion describes if the approaches present tasks in the application domain and their specific uses.\n\tFor example, temporal networks of cell interactions may use comparisons of the sub-graph as small multiples to outline its development.\n\t\\textbf{Evaluation}\n\tThe last comparison criterion concerns evaluations, case studies, and user studies conducted on the different visualization methods.\n\tOnly a few approaches provide no evaluation at all (\\symNo).\n\tHowever, some evaluations are performed as case studies (\\inlinenlpsymbol{icon_case_study}~), for example, by comparing the scalability to other representation types like parallel coordinate plots to demonstrate hypergraph model advantages.

In comparison to this, timeline- and matrix-based approaches can support medium- and large-sized data-sets with several hundred nodes and hyperedges.\n\tAdditionally, there is a clear evolution, as dynamic support and advanced interactivity are featured more prominently in more recent techniques.\n\tInterestingly, user studies have also become more common over time.\n\tFinally, the aim mainly revolves around improving performance compared to non-hypergraph visualizations.\n\tMost hypergraph visualizations are based on node-link diagrams (or variants thereof) and use regular graph drawing with special nodes or hulls.\n\tThe work by Kapec~ sticks out as an early technique providing an extended, three-dimensional, and scalable model compared to its contemporaries.\n\tHowever, all styles use different colors or shapes on their sub-graphs as visual variables to encode node affiliations.\n\tConsequently, some methods have difficulties presenting an accurate picture of the structure as they rely on overlapping projections or might lose information about hyperedges in the drawing process.\n\tThe interactive adaptations boil down to manipulating positions or viewpoints of the model.\n\tThe main drawback is the scalability, as many methods become  illegible quickly.\n\tThe more advanced node-link-based visualizations offer more accurate, powerful, and scalable methods, encoding the hypergraph (models) using an adaption of preexisting techniques.\n\tFor example, all of them use regular edges.\n\tHowever, they should be interpreted as forming hyperedges through the nodes, sometimes with additional visuals for improved clarity.\n\tThe exception is the Kelp-diagram approach~, as it specializes in fixed point visualizations useful for marking geospatial information.\n\tHowever, this heavily limits its applicability and scalability when compared to the other two approaches.\n\tFor example, the radial representation~ can visualize more hyperedges side-by-side while the MetroSets~ deal with overlap when excessively extended.\n\tThey provide basic-level interactions like highlighting, necessary for interpreting larger data sets.\n\tStill, only the MetroSets~ features labels applied to both nodes and hyperedges.\n\tFurther, they are also the only technique that incorporates support for dynamic data, while radial representations may only partly support it.\n\tNevertheless, the amount of information this style can display is increased compared to the earlier approaches.\n\tThe most common tasks are the search for nodes in the visualization~ and the determination of communities/memberships and connected components~, sometimes to determine their size~.\n\tOther common techniques are membership queries~ and the tracing of connections~. The latter is sometimes extended to determine implicit shares and overlap~ and random walks~.\n\tLess frequent tasks are filtering based on external factors~, evaluating the readability~, classification~, and change detection in models~.\n\tThe matrix-based visualizations feature more scalable techniques to display large correlated data-sets.\n\tThey additionally provide extensive interactions to higher degrees, needed to work with the visualizations in realistic scenarios.\n\tThe PAOHvis approach~ uses a column-wise timeline representation of hyperedges while the other two methods compare the nodes and their affiliations directly in the cells.\n\tTo achieve this, they use the nodes as coordinates while different layers of time or tags represent the underlying data.\n\tStill, Streeb et al.'s technique~ is the only one to render a classic node-link-based model as part of their visualization.\n\tThe latest technique, Hyper-Matrix~, is equally easy to handle but focuses more on connection development for predicting future affiliations and extends the concept to a generic blueprint for hypergraph model visualization through a new architecture and novel visualization technique.", "cites": [7170, 7173], "cite_extract_rate": 0.15384615384615385, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section demonstrates moderate insight by synthesizing key aspects of different hypergraph visualization methods and comparing their scalability, interactivity, and dynamic support.

It connects these challenges across papers to some extent, though without forming a novel or comprehensive framework. The critique is somewhat surface-level, focusing on gaps rather than in-depth evaluation or comparison of the cited approaches."}}

It critically evaluates the state of hypergraph visualization and identifies key promising techniques. However, the synthesis is somewhat constrained, and while abstraction is present, it does not fully rise to the level of meta-level insights or overarching frameworks."}}
