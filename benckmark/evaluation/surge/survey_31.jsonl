Comprised of two models, a generator ($G$) and a discriminator ($D$) both typically represented as neural networks, the two models are trained in a process of adversarial optimization. GANs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in the generation of images , natural language , time-series synthesis , and other domains .\nAlthough GANs achieve state-of-the-art results in many domains, they are known to be notoriously difficult to train, suffering significantly from instability problems . Common failures include mode collapse in which the generator maps different inputs to the same class of outputs which results in highly non-diversified samples; non-convergence due to oscillatory and diverging behaviors during the training of both generator and discriminator; and vanishing or exploding gradients leading to slow learning or a complete stop of the learning process . \nRecent years have seen a plethora of proposed methods to stailize GAN training, including modified network architectures, loss functions, convergence-aiding training strategies, and other methods . Despite the significant progress made, to date none of these methods fully solve the instability problem. This instability poses a significant obstacle to the wider adoption of GANs as an off-the-shelf method, because significant manual parameter tuning is typically required to make the method work .\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey of GAN stabilization methods and to highlight open problems for the progress of the field. We describe the GAN stability problems, identify and categorize existing stabilization methods into five different categories, and include a comparative summary of methods. While each category is presented separately, it should be noted that many of the proposed methods are complementary and can potentially be jointly applied. \nAfter discussing related surveys in Section~\\ref{sec:relwork}, the reader is introduced to the concept of GANs and instability problems in Section~\\ref{sec:gans}. Section~\\ref{sec:gan-variants} surveys different GAN variants, outlining strengths and weaknesses of each of the approaches.

This is a problem for GAN training, since a generator without the ability to produce diverse samples is not useful for training purposes. Discovering and tackling mode collapse is a difficult problem, since the cause of mode collapse is rooted deeply in the concept of GANs.  argued that with the generator greedily optimizing its loss function in order to ``fool'' the discriminator, each generator update is a partial collapse towards mode collapse. An intuitive solution to mode collapse is a well trained discriminator capable of robustly identifying the symptoms of mode collapse.

A crucial aspect in addressing mode collapse is a discriminator with high generalization capabilities \nAll of the above problems contribute to the instability of the GAN training process. These problems are often highly linked with each other and addressing them often takes character of a trade-off. A crucial challenge is the accurate estimation of the generalization capabilities of the discriminator, which in turn would make it possible to properly evaluate the generator.

Nevertheless, this technique has been shown to be limited and often leading to other instability problems. Progressive GAN (PROGAN)  addresses this problem by training the networks in multiple phases, starting from a low-resolution image and minimal network architecture, progressively expanding both networks. Additionally, PROGAN proposes a number of training techniques improving stability for image generation, including pixel normalization and mini-batch standard deviation.\nAnother hierarchical approach is the simultaneous training of multiple GAN pairs. Stacked GAN (SGAN)  stacks pairs of generator and discriminator, each consisting of an encoder and decoder on top of each pair. Apart from calculating standard adversarial loss, at each stack the encoder and decoder calculate the discrepancy between generated and real image (referred to as conditional loss) as well as entropy loss, which prevents mode collapse. All three losses are then combined into a composite loss and used in the joint training of all stacks. Similar to Stacked GAN, GoGAN  trains pairs of WGANs  (see Section~\\ref{sec:intprob}), but uses margin based Wasserstein distance, instead of standard Wasserstein distance.

The energy model is attained by feeding a sample (generated or real) to a discriminator consisting of an encoder and a decoder, calculating its reconstruction cost, and training it to output high energy level for generated and low for real samples. Intuitively, the autoencoder architecture takes into account the complexity of the image. Furthermore, as the autoencoder is trained to focus on reconstructing the most important features (i.e. near the data manifold), it provides feedback on these features for the generator. The autoencoder architecture was initially proposed by , with the loss function being the energy level.

While the dimensions of $p_{r}$ appear to be high, in reality they are usually concentrated in lower dimensional manifolds, which often mirror the most important features of the distribution (for example, a feature of a human face on an image). Such lower dimensional manifolds establish a large number of restrictions for the generator, often making it unattainable for the generator to follow them. This contributes to the disjointedness of generated and real distribution, thus making it easier for the discriminator to perfectly discriminate between the samples.\nLatent space decomposition methods aim at providing additional information to the input latent vector $z$, enabling it to disentangle the relevant features from the latent space. InfoGAN  adopts an unsupervised method which supplies a latent variable $c$ capturing the meaningful features of the real sample on top of the standard input noise vector $z$. InfoGAN then maximizes the mutual information $I(c, G(z,c)$ between $z$ and $c$, transforming the generated sample with $G(z, c)$.

As a divergence, LSGAN has been proven to use the Pearson $\\mathcal{X}^{2}$ divergence.\nNevertheless, the $f$-divergence family is subject to a number of limitations.

Furthermore, in contrast to $f$-divergence in which the discriminator is a binary classifier, the discriminator in an IPM framework is a regression task providing a scalar value and henceforth opening a new avenue for research by treating GANs as an actor-critic problem . Defined as a critic function $f$ in a function class $\\mathcal{F}$ consisting of real-valued, bounded, measurable functions, an IPM measures the maximal distance between two distributions. Given $p_{r}$ and $p_{g}$ on a compact space $\\mathcal{X}$, the IPM metric can be denoted as:\n\\begin{equation}\nd_{\\mathcal{F}}(p_{r}, p_{g}) = sup_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}}\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{r}}[f(x)] - \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{g}}[f(x)]\n\\end{equation}\nOne of the distances which belong to IPM is the \\textit{Wasserstein} or Earth Mover's (EM) distance, which is used in Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)  as the new loss measure. Wasserstein distance is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\nW(p_{r}, p_{g}) = \\inf_{\\gamma\\in\\sqcap(p_{r},p_{g})}\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim\\gamma}[\\parallel x - y \\parallel]\n\\end{equation}\nWasserstein distance has been shown to significantly improve training stability and convergence, dealing particularly well with the distributions support lying on low dimensional manifolds. However, due to the intractability of the infimum term, the critic $f$ needs to be parameterized and weight clipping needs to be applied. A significant drawback is that weight clipping incurs pathological behavior that contributes to slow convergence and not entirely stable training. These problems have been partly addressed by including a gradient penalty instead of weight clipping in the loss function of WGAN-GP . Another shortcoming of the WGAN was discussed by  who argued that the WGAN incurs biased gradients. Their solution to this problem suggests an energy function similar to Wasserstein distance, but without the biased gradients. Furthermore, the Cramer distance is also linked with the kernel embedded space distance, discussed in the next paragraph on Maximum Mean Discrepancy.\nDerived from Generative moment matching networks (GMMN) , Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance is an alternative to Wasserstein distance. Continuous and differentiable like the Wasserstein distance, MMD distance has been applied in Maximum Mean Discrepancy GAN (MMDGAN), which can be seen as a combination of GMMNs and GANs . Essentially, MMD measures the distance between the means of the embedding space of two distributions, using the kernel trick with a Gaussian kernel. In MMDGAN, the Gaussian kernels are replaced by adversarial kernel learning techniques, which is claimed to better represent the feature space. This can be seen as advantageous over WGAN. However, the computational complexity of MMDGAN which increases exponentially with the number of samples is a significant drawback.\nA different IPM approach is adopted in Relativistic GAN (RGAN) , in which the authors argue for a general approach to devising new GAN loss functions. This approach estimates the probability that a generated sample is real, taking into account the probability of a corresponding real sample being real. In other words, we measure the distance between the probability of generated sample being real and the probability of real sample being real. It has been shown that the RGAN approach contributes to overcoming the greedy optimization of the discriminator. Furthermore, the technique outlined in RGAN could be potentially expanded to other GANs.\nOther IPM approaches include Geometric GAN  which draw on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm , utilizing separating hyperplanes to update the generator and discriminator and encouraging the generator to move toward the separating hyperplane and the discriminator to move away from it. Although proven to improve training stability, the Geometric GAN requires expensive  matrix computation. Loss Sensitive GAN (LS-GAN)  is based on the idea that the loss for a real sample should be smaller than the loss for a generated sample, and aims at minimizing the margins between the two. The reasoning behind LS-GAN is that the non-parametric assumption of the discriminator having infinite capacity  leads to instability problems, including vanishing gradients, and argues for a more general margin-based approach. Finally, a more stable and computationally efficient approach has been proposed in Fisher GAN , which incorporates a data-dependent constraint into the loss function. Fisher GAN aims at not only reducing the distance between two distributions, but also the in-class variance of them. Furthermore, it avoids adding weight clipping or gradient penalty.", "cites": [8276, 92, 1925, 8274, 8317, 8273, 64, 8272, 8275, 121], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7692307692307693, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes the concept of Integral Probability Metrics (IPM) by integrating multiple works, highlighting how methods like WGAN, MMDGAN, RGAN, and Fisher GAN differ in their approaches and trade-offs.

Currently, the approach showing the highest empirical improvement is the architecture type. Nevertheless, this is also due to a large number of publications in the area of modified network architecture relative to other GAN variants, low entry barrier, and some of the designs resulting in meticulous parameter optimization. Furthermore, much of the research of this type lacks rigorous theoretical justification and struggles to alleviate all of the training problems, usually showing improvement in only one or two of them . At the same time, loss function variant GANs, although often well justified, such as WGAN , show that their results could also be attained by appropriate hyperparameter optimization of architecture variant GANs such as DCGAN. A comprehensive comparison of GANs  has demonstrated a small improvement in general metrics by state-of-the-art loss type GANs in comparison to architectures such as DCGAN , and that it can be more worthwhile to focus on tuning hyperparameters rather than introducing novel methods.\nAnother survey on convergence in GANs  highlighted that much of the rigorous theoretical analysis is often not fulfilled in reality; GANs can converge in situations they theoretically should not, and vice versa. It is hypothesized that this is mostly due to the nature of gradient descent ascent. Loss function variant GANs hold a big promise, addressing an obvious issue which is the unsuitability of the standard objective function to the GAN game. Furthermore, they often demonstrate more general improvement in training than architecture type GANs. We believe, however, that a significant breakthrough in loss function GANs would require incorporating an alternative to GDA. This could possibly be addressed by the gradient-based variants, which might have the broadest influence, enhancing all types of GANs by introducing a gradient design relevant to the GAN game. Nevertheless, gradient-based methods are still at a too early stage to form any reliable predictions. Similarly to loss function variants, game theory variants could provide an approach capable of the general improvement in the training procedure, addressing the problem of dealing with the non-convex-concave character of the game.

These are batch normalization  and layer normalization . Batch normalization, introduced by  and popularized by , has been shown to greatly improve the optimization of neural networks through normalizing the activations of each layer, allowing each layer to learn more stable distribution of inputs. Batch normalization was further extended by  who proposed virtual batch normalization, which aims to make the input sample less dependent on other samples in the batch, thereby alleviating the mode collapse problem.

Layer normalization was initially used in the work of .\nFrom a representation standpoint, the most effective method proposed up-to-date has been spectral normalization .

This is achieved by training the generator on the intermediate layer of the discriminator.\n    \\item[Minibatch discrimination ] --- A method aimed at hindering mode collapse, minibatch discrimination offers a method for penalizing strong similarity between generated samples. By adding a layer in the discriminator, minibatch discrimination is able to compute the cross-sample distance and measure the diversity of generated data. The discriminator still outputs a single probability, but offers the data computed with the use of minibatch as side information.\n    \\item[Historical averaging ] --- Designed to avoid the oscillating and cyclical behavior of GANs, historical averaging incorporates past values of parameters into the player's cost function by adding a term $\\parallel\\theta - \\frac{1}{t}\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\theta[i]\\parallel^{2}$, with $\\theta[i]$ being the value of the parameters at past time $i$.\n    \\item[One-sided label smoothing ] --- Hindering the discriminator from becoming overconfident and squashing generator's gradients, one-sided label smoothing restricts the discriminator to output the probabilities between 0.1 and 0.9, instead of 0 and 1, thus handicapping the discriminator and alleviating the vanishing gradient problem. \n    \\item[Noise injection ] --- Designed to tackle the training instability problem, in particular, vanishing gradients problem, injecting continuous noise to the inputs of the discriminator leads to smoothing the distribution of the probability mass, thus reducing the problem of non-overlapping support, problematic especially for standard GAN. Noise injection has been shown to be computationally efficient and practical , however, leading to a lower quality of the generated image .\n\\end{description}", "cites": [8292, 64, 117, 101], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a clear description of several heuristic techniques for GAN stabilization, with references to relevant papers.
