The goal of WSOD is to instead detect every possible object instance from the given image scene. This makes WSOD a little more difficult than WSOL.}}, we consider these as a common task due to several reasons: 1) these tasks learn with the same image-level human annotation; 2) these two tasks need certain supervision as input and usually aim to localize objects on the bounding-box level as output; 3) WSOD task can be accomplished by directly training off-the-shelf fully supervised object detectors on the object locations obtained from WSOL.\nDuring the last decade, considerable efforts have been made to develop various approaches for learning object detectors with weak supervision.\nSome of the existing algorithms only learn weakly supervised object detectors for one or several certain object categories, such as vehicles~, traffic signs~, pedestrians~, faces~, tuberculosis bacilli~, aircrafts~, and human actions~.\nWhile other approaches, e.g., , focus on developing weakly supervised learning frameworks for unconstrained object categories, i.e., learning frameworks can be extended to learn object detector for the given category-specific weakly-labelled training images.\nAs enormous methods have been developed for these important tasks, a comprehensive review of the literature concerning weakly supervised object localization and detection is of great importance.\nAs weakly supervised object localization and detection methods mainly exploit the image-level manual annotation, the learning frameworks not only need to address the typical issues, such as the intra-class variations in appearance, transformation, scale and aspect ratio, encountered in conventional fully supervised object localization and detection task, but also the \\textbf{learning under uncertainty} challenges caused by the inconsistency between human annotations and real supervisory signals.\nIn weakly supervised object localization and detection, the accuracy of object locations and learning processes are closely related.\nThe key is to propagate the image-level supervisory signals to the instance-level (bounding-box-level) training data for the learning processes.\nAs each training image can be labeled by numerous bounding boxes of different accuracy, propagating such weak supervision inevitably involves a large amount of ambiguous and noisy information as each training instance.\nMore specifically, the \\textbf{learning under uncertainty} issue would cause the following challenges that make the weakly supervised learning process challenging:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item \\textbf{Learning with inaccurate instance locations:} This issue is mainly caused by the definition ambiguity in object parts and context.\n Without precise annotation or definition, it is difficult for a learner to decide whether an object category label associates with a discriminative object part, the whole object region, or the object with a certain context region.\n As a result, the bounding-box instance locations inferred by the learner may contain many inaccurate samples including the ones with local object parts or undesired contextual regions.\n These samples would negatively affect the performance of WSL-based detectors.\n \\item \\textbf{Learning with noisy samples:} Even when the bounding-box locations can be precisely labeled, the training examples enclosed by bounding-boxes may still be noisy as background pixels are usually included.\n As there is no additional information to separate foreground objects from the background, the learner may tag a ``background'' label to an object region when it fails to recognize the object category.\n In addition, the learner may mistakenly label a bounding-box that contains a bicycle as a motorcycle, as these two object categories share many similar features.\n \\item \\textbf{Learning with domain shifts:} For a certain object category, the image regions localized during the learning process may only contain samples with limited diversity in object shape, appearance, scale, and view angle.\n This makes the subsequent learning process biased to limited knowledge of the object category and does not generalize well for test samples.\n For instance, a learner can hardly localize or detect a flying swan when all the training samples contain the swimming ones on lakes.\n This issue happens frequently among the weakly supervised learning process when there is a large gap between the training and testing domains.\n \\item \\textbf{Learning with insufficient instance samples:}\n Similar to the issues in conventional learning methods, it is difficult to train effective object detectors under the weakly-supervised setting when the amount of training samples is limited.\n In addition, the number of positive samples is usually much smaller than that of negative samples for binary classes.\n Furthermore, the data distributions for a large number of categories is usually long-tailed.\n This issues are significantly exaggerated for the WSL-based methods using deep learning.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{illustration.jpg}\n \\caption{Illustration of the weakly supervised learning tasks in computer vision community. The blue area in the top block indicates the conventional fully-supervised learning tasks, while the red area in the top block indicates the weakly supervised learning tasks. The coordinate axes shows different levels of human annotation or supervision requirement, from low cost to high cost. Notice that the high cost annotation can be transformed to low cost annotation easily, e.g., from bounding-box level to image level, whereas the low cost annotation is hard to be transformed to high cost annotation. In the bottom block, we also show the label cost, in terms of annotation time, and the examples of different type of annotations. In this survey, we mainly focus on reviewing the research progress in weakly supervised object localization and detection, i.e., the red dot in the top block.}\n \\label{illustration}\n\\end{figure}\nTo address the above-mentioned issues in learning weakly supervised object detectors, existing methods are usually constructed based on two steps: initialization and refinement.\nThe initialization stage is used to leverage certain prior knowledge to propagate image-level annotation into instance level, and thus can generate instance-level annotation (but with label noise, sample bias, and limited quality in location accuracy) for the learning process.\nThe refinement stage is used to leverage new instance samples obtained from the first stage to mine truthful knowledge about the objects of interest gradually and finally obtain the desired object models for localization and detection.\nThese two learning stages need to collaborate to address the aforementioned five-fold challenges.\nIn initialization stage, efforts should be made to improve the annotation quality as much as possible to generate training instances with proper locations, accurate labels, high diversity, and high recall rate.\nAs the annotation quality obtained in the learning stage cannot be perfect, in the refinement stage, further efforts should be made to improve the learner's robustness to cope with the inaccurate instance location, noisy examples, biased instance sample, insufficient instance sample issues as well as the capacity to take advantage of the unlabelled instance samples.\nWhen properly addressing the problems in each learning stage,\ngood weakly supervised object detectors can be learned.\nIn this work, we review the existing weakly supervised object localization and detection approaches\\footnote{Some early methods, such as~, learn to localize category-wise key points under the weak supervision, while this survey mainly focuses on the methods for localizing instances with bounding-boxes.}, which are divided into three main categories and eight subcategories.\nThese three main categories are based on classic approaches, feature representations from off-the-shelf deep models, and deep learning frameworks.\nThe eight subcategories include approaches for initialization, refinement, initialization and refinement, pre-trained deep features, inherent cues in deep models, fine-tuned deep models, single-network training, and multi-network training.\nWe further discuss the relationship between the approaches in different categories.\nIn addition, we also discuss open problems and challenges of current studies and propose several promising research directions in the future for constructing more effective weakly supervised object localization and detection frameworks.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{category2.jpg}\n \\caption{In the left block, taxonomy of the existing approaches for weakly supervised object localization and detection, which includes three main\n categories and eight subcategories.\n In the right block, the relationships between the approaches in different categories are shown.\n}\n \\label{taxonomy}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{history.JPG}\n \\caption{Developments of weakly supervised localization and detection methods.

Specifically, GT Loc judges the localization results as correct when the intersection over union (IoU) between the ground-truth bounding box and the estimated box is no less than 50\\%, while Top-1 Loc considers the localization results as correct when the class predicted with the highest score is equal to the ground-truth class and the estimated bounding box has no less than 50\\% IoU with the ground-truth bounding box . Top-5 Loc differs from Top-1 Loc in that it checks if the target label is one of the top 5 predictions. As can be seen, the Top-1 Loc is a harder metric than the GT Loc as it needs to additionally predict the class label correctly. This will dramatically increase the task difficulty when performing under very large or fine-grained semantic spaces. The difficulty of Top-5 Loc is between Top-1 Loc and GT Loc as it requires the model to predict the class label but does not restrict the prediction to be perfectly correct.}\n {We provide a brief summarization of the characteristics of the aforementioned datasets in Table \\ref{tab:dataset}. We additionally show some examples from each dataset to illustrate the bias of image content in different datasets. As displayed in Fig. \\ref{dataset}, the PASCAL datasets contain relatively more complex image content, where multiple object instances and categories may appear in a single image and different images would contain objects with significant scale variations. Although it only contains 20 object categories, its category diversity is higher than the CUB-200-2011 dataset as all the 200 categories in the CUB-200-2011 dataset are related to birds. ILSVRC 2016 contains far more images and categories than the PASCAL datasets. However, the content of the images from the ILSVRC 2016 dataset tends to be simpler than that of the PASCAL datasets---each of the images from the ILSVRC 2016 dataset typically contains only one single object and the objects have more consistent sizes and are placed in clearer background context relative to those from the PASCAL datasets. }\\\\\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9.5 cm]{videoapp.jpg}\n \\caption{Weakly supervised object localization or detection methods for video understanding.

The goal is to alleviate the influence of the noisy samples during the learning process. In implementation, such learning strategy is usually achieved by selecting easy and confident training samples in the early learning stages while using hard and more ambiguous training samples in the late learning stages. Essentially, a number of recent methods have already introduced the robust learning strategies into their learning frameworks. For example, Shi and Ferrari  propose a curriculum learning strategy to feed training images into the WSOL learning loop in order from images containing bigger objects down to smaller ones. The training order is determined by the size of the object, which is estimated based on a regression model. Similarly, Zhang et al.  design a zigzag learning strategy, where they first develop a criterion to automatically rank the localization difficulty of an image, and then learn the detector progressively by feeding examples with increasing difficulty. As can be seen, these methods are just intuitive ways to introduce robust learning strategy into the weakly supervised object localization and detection frameworks, while they have already achieved obvious performance gains when compared with the conventional learning strategy. Along this line, Zhang et al.  propose a self-paced curriculum learning framework for weakly supervised object detection. By integrating the curriculum learning  with the self-paced learning , the established learning framework provides a more theoretical-sounded way to improve the learning robustness.

Several existing methods~ have also demonstrated that designing deep reinforcement learning frameworks to model such a sequential searching process can indeed help to address the object localization, detection, and tracking problems in the computer vision community. Thus, it is highly desirable, both biologically and computationally, to explore deep reinforcement learning models that facilitate the weakly supervised object localization and detection systems in such a sequential searching process .\nThe second one is the generative adversary learning. As we know, generative adversary learning has been demonstrated to have advantages in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning scenarios . It can generate the desired data distribution based on very weak supervision, i.e, ``real'' or ``fake''.
