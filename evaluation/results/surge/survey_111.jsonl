RS enhance users' decision-making process and support sales\nby personalizing item recommendations for each user and helping them discover novel products. RS are a pervasive part of user experience online today and serve as the primary choice for many consumer-oriented companies such as Amazon, Netflix, and Google (e.g., YouTube~).\nAmong different recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering (CF) methods have been the mainstream of recommendation research both in academia and industry due to their superb recommendation quality. CF builds on the fundamental assumption that users who have expressed similar interests in the past will maintain similar choices in future~, and infers target user preference over unseen items by leveraging behavioral data of other users and exploiting similarities in their behavioral patterns.\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width = 0.90\\linewidth]{Pictures/From_CF_to_SecureCF.pdf}\n    \\caption{Milestones of CF recommender models.}\n    \\label{fig:milestones}\n\\end{figure}\nMilestones in CF models over the last three decades are illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:milestones}. We can identify two major eras in development of CF models based on their main objective:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The era focused on maximizing/enhancing the recommendation accuracy and beyond-accuracy; \n    \\item The post neural era, the transition era from classical learning to adversarial machine learning.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\noindent \\textbf{Accuracy maximization and beyond-accuracy enhancement era.} In this era, the main effort of research and practitioner-scholars was concentrated on the \\dquotes{golden objective} of \\textit{maximizing recommendation accuracy}. Consequently, machine-learned models tend to use any available signal in the data to reach this goal, even though some of the data contained noise as the results of users' misoperations. We distinguish between two classes of CF techniques in this era: (i) classical non-neural CF, (ii) deep neural CF, each described in the following.\n\\begin{itemize} \n    \\item \\textbf{Classical non-neural CF.} The starting of this era dates back to the 1990s and is still progressing. Over these three decades, the study on CF methods has been the subject of active research by the RS community resulting in a diverse set of models and evaluation measures to assess the effectiveness of these models. We can classify these CF approaches based on various dimensions. For example, from a \\textit{learning paradigm} perspective, CF models can be classified according to (i) \\textit{memory-based CF} and (ii) \\textit{model-based CF} models, in which the former category makes recommendation based on the similarity of users-user interactions (i.e., user-based neighborhood model) or item-item interactions (i.e., item-based neighborhood model) while the latter category predicts users' feedback of unseen items using latent factor models such as matrix-factorization (MF)~. From the \\textit{model training} perspective, it is possible to categorize these models based on the loss functions employed according to (i) \\textit{point-wise} loss where the goal is to optimize towards a predefined ground-truth (e.g., matrix factorization approach based on SVD), (ii) \\textit{pairwise ranking loss} where the goal is to optimize personalized ranking  (e.g., matrix factorization based on BPR) and (iii) \\textit{list-wise} loss where the objective is to reflect the distance between the reference list and the output list ~.\n\t\\item \\textbf{Deep neural CF.}  Another milestone is concerned with the success of  \\dquotes{neural} technology in machine learning (ML). DNNs have shown to be capable of providing remarkable accuracy in several predictive tasks and domains such as image classification~ and speech recognition~ among others. In the field of RS, DNNs have been shown useful for the recommendation in several ways such as extracting deep features (via using CNNs), modeling item content in CF models by integrating side item information, building CF models by parameterizing latent factor models into layers of a DNN (deep CF), and modeling sequential relations (via using RNNs). As for deep-CF approaches, while MF assumes that the \\textit{linear interaction} between user and item latent factors can explain observed feedback, deep CF models can model a more complex representation of hidden latent factors by \\textit{parametrization of MF via a DNN}.   \n\\end{itemize}\n\\updated{The above system types have been redesigned to use a wealth of side information beyond the URM into the recommendation models to make RS adapted in specific domains. The surveys~ provide a good frame of reference for CF methods leveraging rich side information.} \n\\noindent \\textbf{The post neural era, the transition era from classical learning to adversarial machine learning.} Despite the significant success of DNNs to solve a variety of complex prediction tasks on non-structured data such as images, recently, they have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to \\textit{adversarial examples}. Adversarial examples (or adversarial samples) are subtle but non-random perturbations \\textit{designed} to dictate a ML model to produce erroneous outputs (e.g., to misclassify an input sample). The subject started booming after the pioneering work by~ reported the vulnerability of DNNs against adversarial samples for the image classification task. It has been shown that by adding a negligible amount of adversarial perturbation on an image (e.g., a panda), a CNN classifier could misclassify the image in another class (e.g., a gibbon) with high confidence.  These results were quite shocking since it was expected that state-of-the-art DNNs that generalize well on unknown data do not change the label of a test image that is slightly perturbed and is human-imperceptible. Algorithms that aim to find such adversarial perturbations are referred to as \\textit{adversarial attacks}. As ML models are involved in many consumer safety and security-intensive tasks such as autonomous driving, facial recognition, and camera surveillance, adversarial attacks pose significant concerns to the security and integrity of the deployed ML-models.\nIn the field of RS, numerous works have reported the failure of machine-learned recommendation models, i.e., latent-factor models (LFM) based on CF like MF and deep CF methods widely adopted in modern RS, against adversarial attacks. For instance,   showed that by exposing\nthe model parameters of BPR~ to both adversarial and random perturbations of the BPR model parameters, the value of nDCG is decreased by -21.2\\% and -1.6\\% respectively, which is equal to a staggering impact of approximately 13 times difference. One main explanation for such behavior is that adversarial attacks exploit the imperfections and approximations made by the ML model during the training phase to control the models' outcomes in an engineered way~.\nAdversarial machine learning (AML) is an emerging research field that combines the best practices in the areas of ML, robust statistics, and computer security~. It is concerned with the design of learning algorithms that can resist adversarial attacks, studies the capabilities and limitations of the attacker, and investigates suitable countermeasures to design more secure learning algorithms~.\nThe pivotal distinguishing characteristic of AML is the notion of \\dquotes{min-max} game, in which two competing players play a zero-sum differential game, one --- i.e., the attacker --- tries to \\textit{maximize} the likelihood of the attack success, while the other --- i.e., the defender --- attempts to \\textit{minimize} the risk in such a worst-case scenario. In the context of RS, the defender players can be a machine-learned model such as BPR or a neural network, while the attacker is the adversarial model.\nTo protect models against adversarial attacks, \\textit{adversarial training} has been proposed. It is a defensive mechanism whose goal is not to detect adversarial examples, instead to build models that perform equally well with adversarial and clean samples. Adversarial training consists of injecting adversarial samples ---generated via a specific attack model such as FGSM~ or BIM~--- into each step of the training process. It has been reported ---both in RS~ and ML~--- that this process leads to robustness against adversarial samples (based on the specific attack type on which the model was trained on), and better generalization performance on clean samples. For instance, in~, the authors show that the negative impact of adversarial attacks measured in terms of nDCG is reduced from -8.7\\% to -1.4\\% when using adversarial training instead of classical training.\nThe above discussion highlights the failure of classical ML models (trained on clean data) in adversarial settings and advocates the importance of AML as a new paradigm of learning to design more secure models. Nevertheless, the attractiveness of AML that exploits the power of two adversaries within a \\dquotes{min-max} game is not limited to security applications and has been exploited to build novel \\textit{generative} models, namely generative adversarial networks (GANs). The key difference is as follows: the models used in AML for security (or attack and defense) focus only on a class of discriminative models (e.g., classifiers), whereas GANs build upon both discriminative and generative models.\nA GAN is composed of two components: the generator $G$ and the discriminator $D$. The training procedure of a GAN is a min-max game between $G$,  optimized to craft fake samples such that $D$ cannot distinguish them from real ones, and $D$, optimized to classify original samples from generated ones correctly. \nThrough the interplay between these two components, the model reaches the Nash equilibrium where $G$ has learned to mimic the ground-truth data distribution, e.g., a profile of a particular user. In the present survey, we identified different application for GAN-based RS that include, improving negative sampling step in learning-to-rank objective function~, fitting the generator to predict missing ratings by leveraging both temporal~ and side-information~, or augmenting training dataset~.", "cites": [314, 891, 7318, 892, 1189, 923, 1187, 1186, 1188], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 27, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes a range of foundational papers on adversarial machine learning and applies them to the context of recommender systems, particularly collaborative filtering.

Notwithstanding their great success, recent studies have shown that ML/DL models are not immune to security threats from adversarial use of AI. We can classify attacks against a ML model along three main dimensions, attack \\textit{timing} and \\textit{goal}.\n    \\begin{figure}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.70\\paperwidth]{Pictures/posion_evasion_attack.pdf}\n    \\caption{A schematic representation of the distinction between \\textit{evasion} attacks and \\textit{poisoning} attacks.}\n    \\label{figure:attack_scheme}\n\\end{figure}\n\\textbf{Attack timing.} As illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{figure:attack_scheme}, an adversary can attack a ML model at two main stages of the learning pipeline, during \\textit{training} or \\textit{production}. These two categories of attacks are respectively known as (i) \\textit{training-time attack} (a.k.a. causative or poisoning attack)~ and, ii) \\textit{inference-time attack} (a.k.a. exploratory or evasion attack)~.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Poisoning attack.} Data poisoning attacks are realized by injecting false data points into the training data with the goal to corrupt/degrade the model (e.g., the classifier). Poisoning attacks have been explored in the literature for a variety of tasks~, such as (i) attacks on binary classification for tasks such as label flipping or against kernelized SVM~, (ii) attacks on unsupervised learning such as clustering and anomaly detection~, and (iii) attacks on matrix completion task in RS~. As an example, in the pioneering work by~, the authors propose a poisoning attack based on properties of the SVM optimal solution that could significantly degrade the classification test accuracy. \n    \\item \\textit{Evasion attack.} \\updated{Unlike poisoning attacks, evasion attacks do not interfere with training data. They adjust malicious samples during the inference phase. These attacks are also named \\textit{decision-time} attacks referring to their attempt to \\textit{evade} the \\textit{decision} made by the learned model at test time~. For instance, evasion attacks can be used to evade spam~, as well as network intrusion~ detectors. Recently, evasive attacks are conducted by crafting \\textit{adversarial examples}, which are subtle but non-random human-imperceptible perturbations, added to original data to cause the learned model to produce erroneous output.~ were the first to discover that some carefully selected perturbations that are barely perceptible to the human eye, when added to an image, could lead a well-trained DNN to misclassify the adversarial image with high confidence.}\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\textbf{Attack goal.} Attacks are conducted for different goals. We can distinguish between two main classes of attack goals: i) \\textit{untargeted attack} and, ii) \\textit{targeted attack}. To provide the reader with an intuitive insight of the mechanism behind adversarial attacks and defense strategies, we define them formally for a classification task~.\n\\begin{definition}[Untargeted adversarial attack~]\\label{def:untar_attack} The goal of the attacker in \\textbf{untargeted adversarial attack} (misclassification) is to add a minimal amount of perturbation $\\delta$ on the input sample $x$ such that it can cause  incorrect classification.\n Given $f(x;\\theta) = y$, an Untargeted Adversarial Attack is formulated as:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\label{eq:att_untrg}\n        \\begin{aligned}\n            & \\min_{\\delta}\n            & & \\left\\lVert \\delta \\right\\rVert \\\\\n            & \\text{s.t.:}\n            & & f(x + \\delta; \\theta) \\neq y , \\ \\ x + \\delta \\in [0,1]^n\n        \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\nThe second constraint $x + \\delta \\in [0,1]^n$ is a value-clipping constraint needed for images, to bound the adversarial samples into to a predefined range so that the images remain visible after adversarial attack. Alternatively, we can formulate the problem as an unconstrained optimization problem where the goal of the attacker is to \\textit{maximize} the loss between the perturbed sample $x + \\delta$ and true class $y$\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\label{eq:att_rel_gen}\n        \\begin{aligned}\n            & \\underset{\\delta: \\left\\lVert \\delta \\right\\rVert \\leq \\epsilon }{\\text{max}}\n            & &\\ell(f(x+\\delta; \\theta),y) \n        \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\nObviously since adding an unbounded amount of noise on the input will eventually lead to a classification error, the goal of the attacker is to minimize a norm-constrained form of noise, that is $\\left\\lVert \\delta \\right\\rVert \\leq \\epsilon$ for some exogenously given $\\delta$. \\qed\n\\end{definition}\nIn the context of DNN, the above attacks are categorized based on the norm used to represent the magnitude of the noise according to the following norm types~: $l_0$, $l_1$ and $l_2$ and $l_{\\infty}$.\n\\begin{definition}[Targeted adversarial attack~]\n    \\label{def:untar_attack}\nThe goal of the attacker in \\textbf{targeted adversarial attack} is to perturb the input by adding a minimum amount of perturbation $\\delta$ such that it can force the model to misclassify the perturbed sample into an illegitimate target class (aka mis-classification label). Given $f(x;\\theta) = y$, with $y \\neq y_t$, we formulate the problem as:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\label{eq:att_trg}\n        \\begin{aligned}\n            & \\underset{\\delta}{\\text{min}}\n            & & \\left\\lVert \\delta \\right\\rVert \\\\\n            & \\text{s.t.:}\n            & & f(x + \\delta; \\theta) = y_t\n        \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\nSimilarly, the above problem can be expressed as a unconstrained optimization problem \n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\label{eq:att_rel_gen}\n        \\begin{aligned}\n            & \\underset{\\delta: \\left\\lVert \\delta \\right\\rVert \\leq \\epsilon }{\\text{min}}\n            & & \\ell(f(x+\\delta; \\theta), y_t) \n        \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}  \n    \\qed \n\\end{definition}\nThe most common attack types so far exploited in the community of RS are fast gradient sign attack (FGSM)~ and Carlini and Wagner (C\\&W) attacks, which belong to $l_{\\infty}$- and $l_2$-norm   attack types respectively. We provide the formal definition of the FGSM and C\\&W attacks here.\n\\begin{definition}[FGSM attack~]\nThe fast gradient sign method (FGSM)~ utilizes the \\textit{sign of the gradient} of the loss function to find perturbation that maximizes the training loss (for untargeted case)\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\label{eq:att_linf}\n        \\delta = \\epsilon \\cdot \\sign    (\\bigtriangledown_x \\ell(f(x;\\theta),y))\n    \\end{equation}\nwhere $\\epsilon$ (perturbation level) represents the attack strength and $\\bigtriangledown_x$ is the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. input sample $x$. The adversarial example is generated as $x^{adv} = x + \\delta$. FGSM applies an $l_{\\infty}$-bound constraint $||\\delta||_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon$ with the original idea to encourage perceptual similarity between the original and perturbed samples. The unconstrained FGSM  aims to find perturbation that would increase/maximize the loss value. The corresponding approach for targeted FSGM~ is\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\label{eq:att_linf_targeted}\n        \\delta = - \\epsilon \\cdot \\sign    (\\bigtriangledown_x \\ell(f(x;\\theta),y_t))\n    \\end{equation}\nwhere the goal is to maximize the conditional probability $p(y_t|x)$ for a given input $x$.\\qed \n\\end{definition}\nSeveral variants of the FGSM has been proposed in the literature~. For instance, the fast gradient value (FGV) method~, which instead of using the sign of the gradient vector in FGSM, uses the actual value of the gradient vector to modify the adversarial change, or basic iterative method (BIM)~  (a.k.a iterative FGSM) that applies FGSM attack multiple times \\textit{iteratively} using a small step size and within a total acceptable input perturbation level.\n\\begin{definition}[C\\&W attack~]\nThe Carlini and Wagner (C\\&W) attack~ is one of the most effective attack models. The core idea of C\\&W attack is to replace the standard loss function --- e.g., typically cross-entropy --- with an empirically-chosen loss function and use it in an \\textit{unconstrained optimization formulation} given by\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\underset{\\delta}{\\text{min}} \\left\\lVert \\delta \\right\\rVert_p^p + c \\cdot h(x+\\delta, y_t)\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $h(\\cdot)$ is the candidate loss function.\\qed \n\\end{definition}\nThe C\\&W attack has been used with several norm-type constraints on perturbation $l_0$, $l_2$, $l_{\\infty}$ among which the $l_2$-bound constraint has been reported to be most effective~.\n\\textbf{Adversarial attacks on RS - challenges and differences with ML tasks.} In spite of the similarities between ML classification and recommendation learning tasks, there are considerable differences/challenges in adversarial attacks on RS compared with ML and the degree to which the subject has been studied in the respective communities:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Poisoning vs. adversarial attack.} In the beginning, the main focus of RS research community has been on \\textit{hand-engineered} fake user profiles (a.k.a shilling attacks) against rating-based CF~. Given a URM with $n$ real users and $m$ items, the goal of a shilling attack is to augment a fraction of malicious users $\\lfloor{\\alpha n} \\rfloor$ ($\\lfloor{.}\\rfloor$ is the floor operation) to the URM ($\\alpha \\ll 1$) in which each malicious use profile can contain ratings to a maximum number of $C$ items. The ultimate goal is to harvest recommendation outcomes toward an illegitimate benefit, e.g., pushing some targeted items into the top-$K$ list of users for market penetration. Shilling attacks against RS have an established literature and their development face two main milestones: the first one ---since the early 2000s--- where the literature was focused on building hand-crafted fake profiles whose rating assignment follow different strategy according to random, popular, love-hate, bandwagon attacks among others~; the second research direction started in 2016 when the first ML-optimized attack was proposed by~ on factorization-based RS. This work reviews a novel type of data poisoning attack that applies the adversarial learning paradigm for generating poisoning input data. Nonetheless, given their significant impact against modern recommendation models, the research works focusing on \\textit{machine-learned adversarial attacks} against RS have recently received great attention from the research community, \\updated{e.g., consider~.}\n    \\item \\textit{CF vs. classification models:} Attacks against classification tasks focus on enforcing the wrong prediction of individual instances in the data. In RS, however, the mainstream attacks rely on CF principles, i.e., mining similarity in opinions of like-minded users to compute recommendations. This interdependence between users and items can, on the one hand, \\textit{improve robustness} of CF, since predictions depend on a group of instances not on an individual one and, on the other other hand, may cause \\textit{cascade effects}, where attack on individual user may impact other neighbor users~.\n    \\item \\textit{Attack granularity and application type:} Adversarial examples created for image classification tasks are empowered based on continuous real-valued representation of image data (i.e., pixel values), but in RS, the raw values are user/item IDs and ratings that are discrete. Perturbing these discrete entities is infeasible since it may lead to changing the semantics of the input, e.g., loosely speaking applying $ID+\\delta$ can result in a new user $ID$. Therefore, existing adversarial attacks in the field of ML are not transferable to the RS problems trivially. Furthermore, in the context of CV --- attacks against images --- the perturbations often need to be \\dquotes{human-imperceptible} or \\dquotes{inconspicuous} (i.e., may be visible but not suspicious)~. How can we capture these nuances for designing attacks in RS remains as an open challenge.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [314, 891, 1193, 890, 1192, 1191, 892, 923, 1196, 7337, 916, 1194, 1195], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6190476190476191, "origin_cites_number": 21, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key concepts from multiple papers on adversarial machine learning, presenting a structured overview of attack timing (poisoning vs. evasion) and goals (untargeted vs. targeted) with formal definitions and equations.

It performs an ERM against a specific adversary on each sample in $\\mathcal{D}$ and applies a zero sum-game between the prediction and attack adversaries\nleading to the following robust optimization framework\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        \\label{eq:robust_opt_2}\n         \\min_{\\theta}  \\sum_{(x_i,y_i) \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\max_{\\delta: \\left\\lVert \\delta \\right\\rVert \\leq \\epsilon} \\ell(f(x_i+\\delta; \\theta),y_i)\n    \\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is an upper-bound on the adversarial perturbation level $\\delta$.

Thus, in this section we review research works that perform adversarial attacks to undermine the accuracy of recommendation models and measure the impact of the adversarial attack (and defense) via an accuracy evaluation metric.}\nLooking at Table~\\ref{tbl:adl_attack} globally, we note that adversarial personalized ranking (APR)~ by He et. al. was the first work that formally addressed AML to improve the robustness of BPR-MF. After this pioneering work, in the following years, a growing number of works have considered application of AML for different recommendation tasks. Another interesting observation is the co-occurrence of the attack type FGSM and defense model adversarial training (AdReg). In fact, the adversarial training procedure based on FGSM is the first defense strategy proposed by~ to train DNNs resistant to adversarial examples. The authors interpret the improvement in robustness to adversarial examples because the proposed procedure is based on the minimization of the error on adversarially perturbed data.\n\\input{Tables/table_security_datasets_metrics}\nFurthermore, in Table~\\ref{tbl:adl_evaluation}, we provide an overview of the presented approaches under the perspective of experimental evaluation. In particular, we classify the surveyed works according to the \\textit{preference score} used for building/training the recommender models according to implicit and explicit (i.e., rating-based) feedbacks, the prominent \\textit{evaluation metrics} utilized for the offline evaluation of attack success (NDCG, HR, Success Rate, F1, distortion, Precision, and MAP), the \\textit{domain} of focus (e.g., movie, music, social media, business) and \\textit{datasets} used for evaluation. We may notice that, most of the approaches have been tested on an \\textit{implicit} preference type. As for the evaluation metrics, HR is the most adopted one followed by nDCG with a partial overlap among approaches adopting them both. As for the application domain of the datasets used for the evaluation, \\textit{movie} is the most adopted one. This is mainly due to the popularity the Movielens datasets (in their two variants 1M and 100k). Interestingly, \\textit{tourism} is an emerging domain thanks to the availability of the Yelp dataset. Finally, we observe that the high majority of the baselines are based on MF approaches. The following section will provide a detailed description of the most prominent approaches.\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{APR}]  are the first to propose an adversarial learning framework for recommendation. The proposed model, called \\textit{adversarial personalized ranking (APR)}, examines the robustness of BPR-MF to adversarial perturbation on users and items embedding of a BPR-MF~. The authors verify the success of using adversarial training as a defense strategy against adversarial perturbations and demonstrate the competitive results in applying adversarial training on BPR-MF. \\updated{Recently,~ studied application of iterative FGSM-based perturbation techniques and demonstrated the inefficacy of defacto defense mechanism APR in protecting the recommender against such multi-step attacks. For instance, the authors showed that the defended model loses more than 60\\% of its accuracy under iterative perturbations, while only less than 9\\% in the case of FGSM-ones.} \n\\\\\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{AMR}]  put under adversarial framework another BPR model, namely visual-BPR (VBPR). VBPR is built upon BPR and extends it by incorporating visual dimensions (originally based on deep CNN feature) by using an embedding matrix. In~, the authors first motivate the importance for adversarial training of VBPR by visually depicting how a surprisingly modest amount of adversarial perturbation ($\\epsilon = 0.007$) added on raw image pixels \\textemdash~where the added noise is barely perceivable to the human eye \\textemdash~can alter recommendation raking outcomes of VBPR and produce erroneous results. The proposed model therefore consists of constructing adversarial perturbations under the FGSM attack model and adding them to the deep latent feature of items' images extracted by CNN (i.e., ResNet50~) with the goal to learn robust image embedding parameters. One of the key insights about this work is that it does not add perturbations directly on raw image pixels for two main reasons: (i) it would require the feature extractor (CNN) component and the recommender model to be trained end-to-end with overfitting issues on the CNN due to the sparsity of user-item feedback data, (ii) it would be a time-consuming operation because at each update of the recommender model it is necessary to update all the CNN parameters.\nIn the above-mentioned works, the authors adopt several steps to validate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial training framework, which can be summarized according to the following dimensions: (i) the \\textit{generalization} capability, (ii) the comparison of \\textit{adversarial noise v.s. random noise}, and (iii) the \\textit{robustness of models}. Regarding (i), the key insight is that adversarial training approaches (i.e., APR and AMR) can lead to learning model parameters, which can enhance model generalization capability \\textemdash~in other words, improvement of the general performance of recommendation while not being exposed to adversarial perturbation. Concerning (ii), it has been demonstrated that the impact adversarial perturbation on classical recommendation models (e.g., MF-BPR or VBPR) is significantly larger than their random noise counter-part under similar perturbation level. For instance,~ shows that by exposing MF to adversarial and random noise, the test on nDCG is decreased by -21.2\\% and -1.6\\% respectively \\textemdash~i.e., an impact of approximately 13 times difference. Dimension (iii) constitutes the core of the system validations in these works in which compelling evidence has been provided on the vulnerability of classical recommendation models to adversarial examples, or equivalently the robustness of the proposed training framework against adversarial samples. To provide an illustrating example, in~ it has been shown for an experiment on the Amazon dataset, that by changing the perturbation level from $\\epsilon = 0.05$ to $\\epsilon = 0.2$, the amount of decrease in nDCG ranges from -8.7\\% to -67.7\\% whereas for AMR it varies from -1.4\\% to -20.2\\%. These results suggest that approaches using adversarial learning instead of classical learning act significantly in a more robust way against adversarial perturbations.\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{AdvIR}] In~, the authors propose a system to address CF recommendation based on implicit feedbacks. The main issue in learning from implicit interaction is characterized by scarcity of negative feedbacks compared with positive ones, regarded as one-class problem. Sampling uniformly from unobserved data, known as \\textit{negative sampling }, has been introduced in prior work to address this issue. The proposed system in~ is called AdvIR, which entails an adversarial sampling and training framework to learn recommendation models from implicit interactions. The system applies adversarial training on both positive and negative interaction separately, to create informative adversarial positive/negative samples. The proposed adversarial training approach works for both discrete and continuous input by adding the adversarial perturbation directly on the input vector (e.g., one-hot encoding user-id).\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{ACAE / FG-ACAE}]  use the adversarial training framework for a neural network-based recommendation model, namely collaborative denoising auto-encoder (CDAE)~, based on which the authors propose two variations, namely: i) the adversarial collaborative auto-encoder (ACAE) and (ii) fine-grained collaborative auto-encoder (FG-ACAE). ACAE applies adversarial noise on encoder and decoder parameters and adopts an adversarial training framework. FG-ACAE considers the impact of adversarial noise in a more fine-grained manner. In particular, in FG-ACAE adversarial noise is added not only on encoder and decoder but also on the user's embedding matrix as well as hidden layers of the network. Furthermore, to increase the flexibility of training, all the noise factors in ACAE and FG-ACAE are controlled by different parameters. The experimental results confirm the trend that AdReg may improve the model's robustness against adversarial perturbed input, as well as the generalization performance of recommenders.\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{ATF}]  combine tensor factorization and adversarial learning to improve the robustness of pairwise interaction tensor factorization (PITF)~ for context-aware recommendation. Comparison with standard tensor models in tag recommendations acknowledges that the adversarial framework outperforms state-of-the-art tensor-based recommenders.\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{FNCF}]  approach security issues for C\\&W  attacks~. The authors propose to make more robust neural network-based collaborative filtering models (e.g., NCF~) by using knowledge distillation~ instead of the adversarial (re)training. The framework integrates  knowledge distillation with the injection of additive adversarial noise at training time. Experiments demonstrate that this system enhances the robustness of the treated recommender model.\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{SACRA}]  propose a novel recommender model, named Click Feedback-Aware Network (CFAN), to provide query suggestions considering the sequential search queries issued by the user and her history of clicks.\nThe authors employ additional adversarial (re)training epochs (i.e., adding adversarial perturbations on item embeddings) to improve the robustness of the model. \\updated{A similar approach has been also implemented by~ to robustify a self-attention sequential recommender model, named [\\textbf{SAO}].}\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{TAaMR}]  explore the influence of targeted adversarial attacks (i.e., FGSM, and PGD~) against original product images used to extract deep features in state-of-the-art visual recommender models (i.e., VBPR~, and AMR~). The authors verify that recommendation lists can be altered such that a low recommended product category can be pushed by adding adversarial noise on product images in a human-imperceptible way.   \\updated{Within a similar scenario,~ verify, in the \\textbf{VAR} framework, the inefficacy of the adversarial robustification of the image feature extractor component in protecting the visual recommender from such adversarial perturbations}.\\\\\n\\updated{\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{AIP}] Similar to TAaMR~,~ propose a series of adversarial attacks to increase the recommendability of items by perturbing the products images.

The authors demonstrate the application of IRGAN for web search, item recommendation and question answering tasks where for the item recommendation task, the query is constructed from the user's historical interactions.\nDuring adversarial learning ---the min-max game--- the generator learns the actual distribution of relevant items as much as possible.  It turns out that this novel training idea results in a more satisfactory accuracy in recommendation than optimizing the traditional pure discriminative loss functions based on pointwise, or pairwise, objectives.\n\\input{Tables/gan_rs.tex}\n\\\\ \\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{GraphGAN}]  propose GraphGAN --- a graph-based representation learning --- (a.k.a. network embedding) for CF recommendation. Graph-based analysis is gaining momentum in recent years due to their ubiquity in real-world problems such as modeling user preference for item recommendation as well as social graphs in social media (SM) networks, co-occurrence graph in linguistics, citation graph in research, knowledge graph and so forth. The central idea of network embedding is to represent each entity in a graph with a lower-dimensional latent representation to facilitate tasks within the network and prediction over entities. For example, such latent representation makes it possible to perform prediction for supervised tasks, while the distance between node embedding vectors can serve as a useful measure in unsupervised tasks. GraphGAN can be viewed as a graph-based representation of IRGAN, where queries/items are \\textit{nodes} of the graph. For a given node $v_c$, the objective of $\\mathcal{G}$ is to learn the ground-truth connectivity distribution over vertices $p_{true}(v|v_c)$, whereas $\\mathcal{D}$ aims to discern whether or not a connectivity should reside between vertex pairs $(v,v_c)$. GraphGan furthermore proposes the graph softmax as $\\mathcal{G}$ ---instead of traditional softmax--- which appears to boost the computational efficiency of training (graph sampling and embedding learning) performed by  $\\mathcal{G}$.\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{GAN-HNBR}] From an application perspective, GAN-based graph representations have also been applied in more niche domains of RS, including personalized citation recommendation.

This is different from the original GAN in the CV domain in which the output of $\\mathcal{G}$ is an image (i.e., a vector). The generation of discrete item indices by $\\mathcal{G}$ results in a poor sampling of items from the pool of available alternatives (i.e., samples identical to ground-truth) deteriorating the performance of $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ ---instated of improvement--- during the min-max training iteration. CFGAN introduces \\textit{vector-wise\ntraining} in which $\\mathcal{G}$ generates continuous-valued vectors to avoid misleading $\\mathcal{D}$, which in turn improves the performance of both $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$. The authors show the improvement of CFGAN over IRGAN and GraphGAN baselines. As an example, with regards to P@20 on the Ciao dataset, the improvement is $100\\%$  for CFGAN vs. IRGAN (0.45 v.s. 0.23) and $160\\%$ for CFGAN vs. GraphGAN (0.45 v.s. 0.17), which turns to be a significant improvement of the recommendation accuracy.\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{Chae et al.}]  propose an auto-encoder-based GAN, in which an auto-encoder (AE) is used as $\\mathcal{G}$ to model the underlying distribution of user preferences over items.

Items belonging to a specific domain share characteristics and attributes, which are intrinsically similar, and domain-specific recommendation models allow the designer to study these characteristics individually. However, \\textit{single-domain} recommendation faces numerous challenges. The first challenge refers to the well-known \\textit{cold-start} problem, when insufficient interactions exist in the considered domain. Second, users' interests and needs span across different application areas and large e-commerce sites, like Amazon or eBay, store users' preference scores related to products/services of various domains ---from books and products to online movies and music. As companies strive to increase the diversity of products or services to users, cross-domain recommendation can help such companies to increase sales productivity by offering personalized cross-selling or bundle recommendations for items from multiple domains~. The third aspect is a novel research idea related to discovering relationships between items (e.g., images) of two different domains. For example, can a machine achieve a human-level understanding to recommend a fashion item consistent with user taste/style in another domain such as media or visual scenery? \n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{FR-DiscoGAN}]\nIn~, the authors propose a cross-domain GAN to generate fashion designs from the sceneries. In the proposed hypothetical scenario, the user can specify via a query her POI to visit (e.g., mountain, beach) together with keywords describing a season (i.e., spring, summer, fall, and winter). The core idea is to automatically generate fashion items (e.g., clothes, handbags, and shoes) whose useful features (i.e., style) match the natural scenery specified by the user. For instance, the system can recommend a collection of fashion items that look cool/bright for visiting a beach in summer, even though the actual preference of the user is black-style clothes. The role of GAN is to learn associations between scenery and fashion images. In the field of ML and CV, the problem is termed as \\dquotes{style transfer} or \\dquotes{image to image translation} problem~. \\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{VAE-GAN-CC}]\nAn effective cross-domain recommendation system relies on \\textit{capturing both similarities and differences} among features of domains and exploiting them for improving recommendation quality in multiple domains. Single-domain algorithms have difficulty in uncovering the specific characteristics of each domain. To solve this problem, some approaches extract latent features of the domains by a separate network~. Although these approaches might be successful in capturing characteristic features of each domain, they do not establish the similarity between features of multiple domains. To extract both homogeneous and divergent features in multiple domains,  propose a generic cross-domain recommendation system that takes as input the user interaction history (click vector) in each domain,  maps the vectors to a shared latent space using two AEs and then uses $\\mathcal{G}$ to remap the underlying latent representation to click vectors. The main novelty of this work lies in building/linking shared latent space between domains, which in turn facilitates \\textit{domain-to-domain} translation. In particular, the former is realized by enforcing a weight-sharing constraint related to variational auto-encoders, i.e., the encoder-generator pair $\\{\\mathcal{E}_A, \\mathcal{G}_A\\}$ and $\\{\\mathcal{E}_B, \\mathcal{G}_B\\}$ and using cycle-consistency (CC) as a weight-sharing constraint. Finally, two separate adversarial discriminators are employed to determine whether the translated vectors are realistic. The final system is called VAE-GAN-CC network, which extends the unsupervised image-to-image translation network in the CV domain~ for RS applications and is thus named domain-to-domain translation model (D2D-TM).\\\\\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{DASO}]\nInspired by the efficacy of \\textit{adversarial negative sampling} techniques proposed by~,  address the limitation of typical negative sampling in the \\textit{social recommendation} domain in transferring users' information from social domain to item domain.

This would allow the network to learn the relationship between items directly on the feature space, spanned by the features extracted.

Given a user and a fashion item category (e.g., tops, t-shirts, and shoes), the proposed system generates new images ---i.e., clothing items--- that are consistent with the user's preferences. The contributions of this work are two-fold: first, it builds and end-to-end learning framework based on the Siamese-CNN framework. Instead of using the features extracted in advance, it constructs an end-to-end system that turns out to improve the visual representation of images. Second, it uses a GAN-based framework to generate images that are consistent with the user's taste. Iteratively, $\\mathcal{G}$ learns to generate a product image integrating a \\textit{user preference maximization objective}, while $\\mathcal{D}$ tries to distinguish crafted images from real ones. Generated images are quantitatively compared with real images using the preference score (mean objective value), inception score~, and opposite SSIM~. This comparison shows an improvement in preference prediction in comparison with non-GAN based images. At the same time, the qualitative comparison demonstrates that the generated images are realistic and plausible, yet they are quite different from any images in the original dataset ---they have standard shape and color profiles, but quite different styles.\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{MrCGAN}]  propose a compatibility learning framework that allows the user to visually explore candidate \\textit{compatible prototypes} (e.g., a white T-shirt and a pair of blue-jeans).

It takes as the input a projected prototype (i.e., the transformation of a query image in the latent \"Compatibility Space\"). It produces as the output a synthesized image of a compatible item (the authors consider a compatibility notion based on the complementary of the query item across different catalog categories). Similar to the evaluation protocol in~, the authors conduct online user surveys to evaluate whether their model could produce images that are perceived as compatible. The results show that MrCGAN can generate compatible and realistic images under compatibility learning setting compared to baselines.\n\\setlength{\\parindent}{15pt} [\\textbf{Yang et al.} \\& \\textbf{$c^+$GAN}]  address the same problem settings of MrCGAN~ by proposing a fashion clothing framework composed of two parts: a clothing recommendation model based on BPR combined with visual features and a clothing complementary item generation based GAN. Notably, the generation component takes in input a piece of clothing recommended in the recommendation model and generates clothing images of other categories (i.e., top, bottom, or shoes) to build up a set of complementary items. The authors follow a similar qualitative and quantitative evaluation procedure as DVBPR~ and further propose a \\textit{compatibility index} to measure the compatibility of the generated set of complementary items. A similar approach has also been proposed in $c^+$GAN~, to generate bottom fashion item paired with a given top item.", "cites": [1001, 1209, 1211, 117, 1213, 1212, 1210], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5833333333333334, "origin_cites_number": 12, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple GAN-based approaches for fashion recommendation, connecting CRAFT, DVBPR, MrCGAN, and c+GAN to highlight their shared goal of leveraging adversarial learning for complementary item generation and personalization.

This broad range of applications can be categorized into two ---objective-wise distinct--- technologies: (i) AML for improving security (cf. Section~\\ref{sec:security}) and, (ii) AML used in generative adversarial networks (GANs) exploited for numerous tasks such as better CF recommendation, context-aware recommendation, cross-domain system, or visually-aware fashion item/outfit recommendation (cf. Section~\\ref{sec:GAN}). The common point of both technologies is the joint min-max optimization used for training models, in which two competing players play a zero-sum differential game until they reach an equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that sums up the advances of AML application in recommendation settings and proposes a clear taxonomy to classify such applications.\nWe put forward what is better to invest in AML-RS research and introduce the following open research directions:\n\\noindent\\emph{\\underline{Bridging the gap between attack/defense models in the ML/CV and RS domain.}} \nAs the prior literature of AML for security emerged in the field of machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV), there remains a large gap between advances made in those fields and that in RS. Consider the questions: \\dquotes{Attacks for images are designed to be human-imperceptible or inconspicuous (i.e., may be visible but not suspicious).  How can we capture these notions for designing attacks in RS?}; furthermore, \\dquotes{Images are continuous-valued data while a user profile is a discrete data. Modifying users' profiles completely changes the semantic of their behaviors. What is the best approach to treat these nuances in RS attack designs?} \\\\\n\\emph{\\underline{Choice of recommendation models.}} Modern recommendation models exploit a\nwealth of side-information beyond the user-item matrix such as social-connections, multimedia content, semantic data, among others. However, most of the attacks against recommendation systems are designed and validated against CF systems. Investigating the impact of adversarial attacks against these ---heterogeneous in nature--- data types remains as an open highly interesting challenge, e.g, consider adversarial attacks against music, image, and video recommendation models leveraging multimedia content. In this regard, we also recognize attack against state-of-the-art deep and graph-based models, another highly-valued research direction.\\\\\n\\emph{\\underline{Definition of attack threat model.}} The research in RS community misses a common evaluation approach for attacking/defending scenarios such as the one introduced by Carlini at el.~. For instance, it is important to define a common attacker threat model to establish in advance the attacker knowledge and capabilities to make the attack (or defense) reproducible and comparable with novel proposals.\\\\\n\\emph{\\underline{Move the attention towards beyond accuracy goal in recommendation.}}\nAccording to our survey, most of the identified research works focus on accuracy metrics such as HR and nDCG. Consider the question: \\dquotes{What is the impact of adversarial attacks and defenses in other evaluation objectives of RS, for instance, diversity, novelty, and fairness of recommendations}. The impact on these metrics could be, in principle, the main objective of a new breed of attack strategies aiming at compromise the diversity/novelty of results.\\\\\n\\emph{\\underline{Scalability and stability of learning.}} We identify that there exists the need to further explore the stability learning problems in the discrete item sampling strategy to train the generator. This has been already identified as a big problem when GAN-based RS are applied in real scenarios with huge catalogues. A point of study may be that of novel GAN models proposed in computer vision (e.g., WGAN~, LSGAN~, and BEGAN~).\\\\\n\\emph{\\underline{Users preferences learning with GANs.}} An interesting and already established application of AML-RS is to exploit the generative power of GANs to produce more plausible user-rating profiles that can be used to improve recommendations in the cold-user scenario or improve the prediction performance in warm-start settings. We consider such applications extremely interesting, and we motivate further research in this direction to resolve the well-known cold-start obstacles in recommendation settings.\n\\input{Tables/Recommender_Models.tex}\n\\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}\n\\bibliography{refs_final}\n\\end{document}\n\\endinput", "cites": [7305, 64, 63], "cite_extract_rate": 0.75, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes key ideas from the cited papers, particularly linking AML concepts from ML/CV to RS and suggesting how GANs can address cold-start and generalization issues.
