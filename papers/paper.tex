\title{InsightEval: An Automated System for Evaluating Insightfulness in Scientific Papers}

\begin{abstract}
In scientific writing, impactful work is distinguished by its ability to provide insight, which encompasses both what new information it introduces and the level at which it advances understanding beyond prior work. However, insight is inherently relative to existing literature and is rarely captured by evaluations that focus on writing quality or contribution overlap, leaving insight assessment largely underexplored. We present InsightEval, an automated system for evaluating the insightfulness of scientific papers by jointly assessing information gain and the level of understanding reflected in their claims, relative to cited references. Our approach is inspired by a cognitive hypothesis: after thoroughly reading all references cited by a paper, the extent to which reading the paper enhances a reader's understanding reflects its level of insight. The system operates through four stages: (1) extracting opinion sentences from the target paper; (2) retrieving supporting materials from cited references for each opinion sentence via semantic retrieval; (3) scoring each opinion sentence by jointly evaluating its information gain and its level of understanding—characterized along depth, breadth, and height—using a large language model conditioned on the retrieved supporting materials; and (4) synthesizing the sentence-level evaluations into a paper-level insight report. We deploy InsightEval on over 100 human-written and 100 AI-generated scientific papers, demonstrating its applicability across diverse writing sources. For transparency and inspection, we publicly release the InsightEval source code, a demonstration video, and all generated insight evaluation reports.
