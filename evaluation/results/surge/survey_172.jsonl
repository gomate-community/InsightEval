Spatiotemporal data represent different phenomena ranging from micro-scale of DNA and cell evolution, to global ones, e.g., climate change . The wide-availability of user-generated data via the social media platforms offers great opportunities to understand people needs, thoughts, and sentiments toward specific topics, products, or services . Medical sensory devices observe different activities at various locations of the human body over specific time ranges.\nSTDM proposes new methods to handle such data through advanced predictive and descriptive tasks such as classification and clustering to work best with space and time referenced data. \nSTDM methods are concerned with relationships and dependencies among different measurements. These relationships are complex, implicit, and dynamically changing.\nTo a large extent, classical data mining assumes that data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). On the contrast, spatiotemporal data do not follow this assumption and STDM methods aim to capture the autocorrelation among different events or data points that are interdisciplinary in nature, i.e, data from multiple domains that may require the utilisation of various mining tasks.\n\\newline\n\\newline\nSpatiotemporal data comprise spatial and temporal representations. They include three distinct types of attributes, namely, non-spatiotemporal, spatial and temporal attributes . The non-spatiotemporal attributes represent non-contextual features of objects. Spatial attributes define the locations, extents, and shapes of the objects. Temporal attributes are timestamps and durations of processes denoting spatial object (vector) or field (raster layers). For example, air pollution spatiotemporal data have non-spatiotemporal attributes such as air pollution levels or station names, spatial coordinates of the location where the measurements are taken and temporal timestamps associated with the collected measurements.\nSpatiotemporal data types can also be categorised based on their collection nature to discrete or continuous observations. Events and data trajectories are examples of spatiotemporal discrete data types, while continuous data types include point reference and raster data.\nSpatiotemporal event data constitute discrete events that happen at geo-locations and times such as traffic accidents and crime incidents. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (a) denotes spatiotemporal events of three different types. Each type is presented in different colour and shape, e.g., red circles are for events of one type and each event is annotated with the its location and time (location $l_1$ in time $t_1$).\nTrajectory data contain sequences of spatiotemporal instances that trace motions of objects in geographical spaces overtimes. Trajectories are usually represented by a series of chronologically ordered points which consist of spatial coordinates and timestamps . For instance, a vehicle trajectory between two locations is a set of consecutive points of space and time. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (b) illustrates trajectories of three coloured objects between locations ($l_1$ and $l_n$) at times ($t_1$ and $t_2$). \nPoint reference data measure continuous spatiotemporal fields at moving spatiotemporal reference sites. For example, spatiotemporal point references can be utilised to measure surface temperature using moving balloons. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (c and d) show spatiotemporal point reference data at different locations (black squares) at timestamps ($t_1$ and $t_2$).\nRaster data represent measurements of spatiotemporal fields at fixed cells in  grids such as activities in fMRI brain scans. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (e and f) show spatiotemporal raster data of regular grid at time ($t_1$ and $t_2$).\nThese different types of spatiotemporal data are associated with different research challenges . Classical data mining approaches are not designed to handle such data. \n\\begin{figure}[]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth, angle=0]{ST-Data-2.jpg}\n\\caption{{Spatiotemporal data types.

Specifically, none of these existing researches paid their focus on the general challenging issues in terms of relationships, data, natures and limitations of STDM research or the challenges related STDM tasks and applications.

Neglecting the temporal aspects when analysing and building models from spatiotemporal data and focusing only on spatial attributes leads to unfavourable outcomes. Despite the large volume of work in GIS, there is a little support of temporal data mining in popular GIS . The temporal pattern discovery remains an under-explored area .

These models can be either classification models or regression models. Classification models are for categorical or discrete targets, and regression models are for continuous targets. In STDM, the prediction task formulations are based on the input and output of spatiotemporal data representations. For examples, predicting an output variable, continuous or categorical, using time series at different locations in raster , predicting a scalar output using the complete information in raster data , or predicting spatiotemporal responses using observations collected at other time-stamps in spatial neighbourhoods .\nSTDM prediction methods use extracted discriminative features, e.g., average speed, acceleration, duration, distance, length and direction, from labelled spatiotemporal data to train standard classifiers or regressors. The prediction can be done by single models e.g., Decision Trees (DT) , Support Vector Machines (SVMs)  , or ensembles, e.g., Random Forest (RF)  or deep learning, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) . Other STDM tasks such as clustering can be applied to extract features for prediction. For instance, TraClass  applied segmentation and clustering for the region and sub-trajectory feature extraction, then trained an SVM classification model. STDM trajectory-based prediction estimates the future location or route of moving objects using different methods such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). \nPredictive models predict the next location of a trajectory to build more accurate decisions and deliver more precise recommendations. There are two different approaches proposed based on the moving object or other neighbours, as well as a hybrid approach that combines both . Recently, deep learning-based models have been applied to tackle various spatiotemporal prediction problems, e.g., crowd flow, car-hailing supply-demand, and traffic predictions . Here, the models take into account temporal instances, near and far spatial dependencies, and other influential external factors for the spatiotemporal prediction problem.  tackled another problem of predicting continuous trajectory, not only a single future location. Based on a user's morning trajectory, their model can predict the whole-day trajectory of the user.\nThe spatiotemporal dependencies between multiple contexts cause an imbalance problem as one spatiotemporal event can be rare or infrequent compared to other . This data imbalance problem affects the accuracy of the STDM prediction task.\nThe multi-scale effect or the spatiotemporal discretisation issue also poses another challenge as the results of the spatiotemporal classification or regression vary based on the different scales and zones. In order to train a prediction model, spatiotemporal features must be generated using data aggregation. However, the aggregation process can be challenging in building multiple relationships between spatiotemporal objects to build the feature sets.\nMoreover, the process of generating spatiotemporal features is resource and time-consuming. Spatiotemporal Kriging is an important geo-statistical regression-based interpolation method with a spatiotemporal covariance matrix and variograms. Simply, it can predict the target values at unobserved locations based on observations at other locations, even with noisy data. However, Kriging suffers from the limitation of assuming the isotopic nature of the random variables . {Recently, multiple deep learning-based studies focused on the spatiotemporal trajectory classification, such as using Long Short Ten Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence classification. However, these approaches fail to consider both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. For example, Time-LSTM handles trajectories' temporal information and neglects the spatial ones .}\n{Explanation of the spatiotemporal predictions is another issue of concern. Most existing prediction models are mostly black boxes and, in many decision making applications such as medical diagnosis, understanding of the reasoning behind the predictions are required. The authors in  proposed LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explainations), a method that explains model predictions by learning an interpretable model locally around the predictions. Figure \\ref{LIME} shows the process of explaining model predictions by using different symptoms to predict that a patient has a flu.

STDM clustering methods aim to determine the cluster of a given object based on different features, including spatiotemporal ones. For example, trajectory clustering may harness the similarities using features such as route origins and destinations. There are different approaches used in STDM clustering such as partitioning, hierarchical and density-based. Many statistical models are also used such as HMM, spatiotemporal extensions of the density-based spatial clustering of data with noise (ST-DBSCAN), and time-focused clustering of trajectories of moving objects (T-OPTICS) . TraClus  algorithm works on parts of trajectories in order to define similar trajectories based on visiting the same type of places. Clustering spatiotemporal data is affected by the large size of data which leads to a trade-off between the accurate clustering results and computational cost . It is also affected by noise and outlier patterns. Also, shapes and sizes of patterns add more complexity to spatiotemporal clustering. Spatiotemporal clustering differs according to the data types, such as clustering locations based on thematic attributes over time, clustering moving objects and clustering trajectories. Since a trajectory is a sequence of time-stamped point locations of a moving entity through space, clustering moving trajectories is complex due to their continuous object movement and evolving. Thus, more efforts are needed to discover the interaction and change in the spatiotemporal trajectory movements in order to achieve more accurate clustering . Such efforts may propose modifications of existing clustering algorithms to make them more suitable for spatiotemporal data . \nAnother open issue related to spatiotemporal clustering approaches is related to their evaluation techniques. While traditional clustering approaches require computations in single Euclidean space, the spatiotemporal clustering approaches need computations in multiple spaces . Besides, computing the trajectory similarity based on point matching results in low-accuracy results . Specifically, such methods handle two different point-sequences in a different way albeit they belong to the same trajectory. \nOn the other hand, spatiotemporal hotspots refer to locations that contain an unexpectedly high number of objects in a time . The spatiotemporal hotspot detection is complex because the number and features, e.g., size, shape and number of objects, of hotspots are unknown. STDM hotspot detection task is utilised for identifying dense conglomeration of events both in space and time in applications such as the outbreaks of diseases .  proposed a spatial scan statistical (SSS) method for hotspot detection. The method explores the potential region of multiple circular-shaped sizes. The hotspot is defined as the region with a significantly high incidence of points. Later, multiple methods were proposed to generalise this SSS for spatiotemporal data . However, the problem is still complex as results of shapes of regions, background distributions, and speeds of search. STDM hotspot detection is also utilised in various applications such as public emotion analysis, public safety, and traffic management.  proposed a hotspot detection method for the analysis of public sentiment using geotagged photos. The proposed method detects the emerging concentrations of certain sentiment class.  proposed a hotspot detection for political violence. The proposed method tries to solve the problem of uncertain and less predictable violence against civilians. STDM hotspot detection is employed to explore the potential locations and times of traffic accidents.  proposed a spatiotemporal network kernel density estimation. Using the STDM hotspot detection methods such as scan statistics and kernel density estimation are not useful in such traffic accidents cases. This is because these methods focus on Euclidean space and ignore traffic-related aspects such as constrained road networks . Research studies were proposed to detect hotspots in the network space such as linear route detection which focuses on the spatial aspect and neglects the temporal dimension.", "cites": [5623], "cite_extract_rate": 0.06666666666666667, "origin_cites_number": 15, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information on spatiotemporal clustering and hotspot detection by referencing multiple methods and applications, but the integration is somewhat limited to listing examples rather than constructing a novel framework.

Multiple methods were proposed to mine several types of movement patterns including; periodic or repetitive patterns that concern regular movements which are repeated at certain time intervals such as bird migration , and frequent pattern mining to discover the sequence of visited locations and the transition times between them . Trajectory pattern (T-pattern) is an example of frequent pattern defined by  as a set of trajectories that visit the same sequence of places consuming similar transition time. T-pattern can be mined by analysing sequences of regions of interest with time-stamps  or discretisation of space to determine the regions of interest . Group pattern mining tends to identify movement patterns for groups of objects that move together in near space and time. Several group patterns were proposed based on spatiotemporal closeness constraint, group construction and members' properties. Examples of group patterns include flock , convoy , swarm , leadership  and chasing . They were also studied as mixed-drove or co-occurrences  for time-unordered patterns, spatiotemporal cascades  for partially time-ordered patterns, and spatiotemporal sequential patterns  for totally time-ordered patterns. Mining of spatiotemporal pattern mining has key challenges. One major challenge is that there are no explicit transactions in the spatiotemporal datasets. The number of possible patterns is exponential, and there is a potential for over-counting. Accordingly, these issues lead to a trade-off between the accuracy of the output and computational efficiency. There are different statistical methods used for mining the spatiotemporal co-location patterns, such as cross-K-function, spatial regression model  and mean nearest neighbour distance . However, these statistical methods are computationally expensive due to the exponential number of candidate patterns. Furthermore, discovering spatiotemporal association or co-occurrences from trajectories is challenging due to temporal duration, different moving directions, and wrong locations.", "cites": [5624], "cite_extract_rate": 0.06666666666666667, "origin_cites_number": 15, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from the literature by integrating concepts such as T-patterns, group patterns, and co-location patterns, connecting them under the broader umbrella of spatiotemporal pattern mining.

Spatial visual feature extraction is essential in various tasks such as image classification and hand writing recognition . Spatiotemporal based STDM focuses on learning how to see a scene, understand components, and track moving objects in a video. The complexity of the visual world makes STDM challenging in computer vision tasks. STDM methods has been utilised most computer vision tasks such as tracking  and segmentation . In this section, we focus on recent challenges in visual tracking and segmentation, specifically, drone-based object tracking and amodal semantic segmentation, respectively.\n}\n{\nVisual object tracking (VOT) is a key component of multiple domain application such as surveillance, search and rescue, and topographic mapping. VOT is a challenging task due to visual noise, occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, and dynamic variation of moving object features. VOT methods aim to track the moving objects temporally in a video and spatially over the frame pixels. There are large bodies of research in both single VOT  and multiple VOT . New VOT tasks include object tracking with segmentation , tracking by reconstruction , graph convolutional tracking , \ndeep multi-scale spatial-temporal tracking \nand drone-based VOT .\nIn drone-based object tracking , a drone \\emph{d} is tracking a moving object in real-time \\emph{o} using a camera as illustrated in Figure \\ref{drone}. Unlike conventional object tracking using fixed cameras, a camera mounted on \\emph{d} is moving according to the motion of \\emph{d}.\nWhen \\emph{d} or \\emph{o} moves the distance between them is altered. This fact leads to changes in the location and scale of \\emph{o} in the video frame.\nFigure \\ref{drone} shows three different tracking positions of a drone in different time-stamps monitoring a moving object indicated in light green. As illustrated, the scale of the moving object is inversely related to the size of the drone’s field of view. When the drone flies high and has a wide field of view, the object becomes smaller. Conversely, the object scale is enlarged if the drone gets close.\nNew VOT drone-based dataset have been released such as\nDTB70 , \nUAV123 , \nUAVDT-Benchmark-S , and \nVisDrone2019-SOT . \nThe datasets are of high diversity and captured in multiple environments. They cover more difficulties and aspects that are not found in the traditional tracking datasets such as VOT  and VTB50 . The drone-captured datasets include both translation and rotation camera motions. \nThe literature shows that these datasets are challenging for conventional tracking algorithms. They also cover highly challenging cases in both short-term and long-term occlusion. The datasets contain different moving object types, such as humans, animals, cars, boats, birds and drones. This variety offers different levels of degree of freedom for the motion. Objects like cars and boats can only translate or rotate, whereas humans and animals, birds and drones have a higher degree of freedom. The datasets outdoor scenes are in various situations, including significantly varied backgrounds. These challenging motion characteristics cause object deformation, leading to more difficult object tracking. \n}\n\\begin{figure}[]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth, angle=0]{drone.jpg}\n\\caption{\nDrone-based object tracking .}\n\\label{drone}\n\\end{figure}\n{Video object segmentation (VOS) extracts foreground objects in a video. VOS is a fundamental task for many video analysis tasks such as video summarisation and understanding. Most of VOS related work is either unsupervised, i.e., does not require human annotation  or semi-supervised, i.e., requires to annotate object in the first frame only .\nVOS maintain the temporal associations of object segments through the video usually using optical flow . It aims to model the pixel motion over time. However, optical flow annotation requires expensive human efforts and is not always suitable for VOS. Recently, VOS researcher proposed end-to-end trained deep neural networks to overcome such issues, such as  spatiotemporal sequence-to-sequence network  and deep recurrent network . There are multiple datasets for video object segmentation such as \nDAVIS16 , \nFBMS , \nJumpCut , \nYoutube-Objects , \nSegtrackV1 , \nand instance segmentation data such as\nYoutube-VOS , \nSegtrackV2 , and\nDAVIS17 .\nHowever, none of these datasets offers direct learning of new research directions in VOS such as Semantic Amodal instance level (SAVOS) . SAVOS aims to segment individual objects in a video under occlusion semantically. Figure \\ref{amodal} presents an example showing the steps of segments annotation, depth and visible edge estimation, and annotating the edges of the invisible regions. SAVOS is a useful task for object size prediction, depth ordering, and occlusion reasoning. This task requires the temporal sequence, in the video dataset, to be densely and semantically labelled. Such data should be essential to analyse the object and human motion behaviours. New datasets have been released recently to fit the SAVOS task such as .

Besides, thematic data related to traffic accidents, injuries and road networks combined with criminal records is an important multidisciplinary path of research that needs more efforts. Traffic data represents spatiotemporal trajectories that are used to discover periodic patterns that describe the behaviours of moving objects . One important challenge is that the spatiotemporal trajectory pattern does not follow regular time intervals .\nFurthermore, the influence of nearby objects and their patterns is another problem. Example of such influence is spatiotemporal events, such as accidents, that affect the traffic congestion patterns . Traffic congestion estimation is another open issue due to the complexity of analysing multiple data from different sources, e.g., sensors in taxicabs, GPS, mobile sensors, and road network sensors, and the inclusion of various variables such as density, velocity, inflow and previous status .

Traffic estimation is still a challenging task due to the uncertainty issue because of data sparsity and semantic ambiguity. Trajectory embeddings are tackled by the complicated topology of the transportation networks. Modelling such data is affected by the spatiotemporal dynamicity.\nMoreover, intelligent transportation systems have other essential components, such as Region-Level Ride-Hailing (RLRH) demand forecasting. RLRH demand forecasting aims to estimate the future demand in city regions given the previous states. RLRH demand forecasting tends to enhance traffic functions such as vehicle allocations, waiting time, and congestion .

There seems to be an unfair distribution of jobs among drivers which led to concerns such as discrimination against minorities. Having each matching to be fair is a difficult task. Therefore, there is a need for more efforts in STDM to discover better matching distributions over time.

Consequently, real-time large-scale sensor data are captured via distributed connected objects equipped with sensors. These sensors can monitor different variables at multiple locations such as homes, ambient air quality, climate and earthquakes . Working with such data poses some challenges while storing, processing and modelling, which can be addressed by utilising cloud computing . Sensory data suffers from sparsity where no observations are captured for many regions within the sensed fields. This requires more efforts in filling the missing values using correlated data sources. However, the integration process is complicated because of the different sampling rates of various sensory data. For example, the temporal resolution in medical sensors is much higher than in GPS sensors. Also, the sensory data integration is complicated by the veracity of the different measurements recorded by each sensor. For instance, there is a high level of uncertainty caused by the difficulty in spatial localisation and temporal synchronisation between sensors . \n{\nIoT opens new research directions, such as sitting posture monitoring and smart voice control. The poor sitting posture causes ill-effects on both physical and mental health. Sitting posture monitoring is challenged by multiple issues such as the variance in human sitting behaviours and divergence in user body mass indexes . Smart voice control is being used by 100 million users . Different users can use multiple appliances at the same time. There is a need for new STDM methods that can consider the possible variant spatial, temporal, and thematic features.

STDM aims at discovering beneficial relationships and patterns that are implicit in spatiotemporal data. In this regard, STDM focuses on the design of efficient and scalable algorithms to mine, i.e., extract, predict, cluster, and quantify spatiotemporal patterns. Performing STDM is more difficult than traditional data mining due to the complex types of spatiotemporal relationships, interdisciplinary nature of data and tasks, and the unique characteristics of spatiotemporal data. \nFuture research should focus on developing new modelling and visualisation methods that enable the integration of multiple STDM tasks to solve more complex scenarios. \nIn this paper, we described the STDM problems and open gaps. We explained general issues related to spatiotemporal relationships, interdisciplinarity, discretisation, data characteristics, and research limitations. In an attempt to produce a comprehensive survey about the STDM challenges, we discussed the tasks and applications related challenges.\n\\section*{acknowledgements}\nAli Hamdi is supported by RMIT Research Stipend Scholarship.

Congratulations to the authors!\n\\newline\n\\textcolor{blue}{We extended  the big data and cloud computing section (3.4.9) to include spatial cloud computing as follows:}\n\\newline\n\\textcolor{red}{Specifically, conventional cloud computing techniques are not designed to handle the spatiotemporal data. Therefore, spacial cloud computing techniques have recently been proposed to leverage a layer of data-as-a-service (DaaS) to virtualise the spatiotemporal data . \nThe advancements of the GIS harnessed the wide availability of the cloud-based spatiotemporal services . Spatiotemporal data storage and parallel processing are widely provided by open-source cloud systems . Other technologies such as Esri Geospatial Cloud and Google Earth Engine are also providing significant Earth observations spatiotemporal data. Overall, spatial cloud computing aims to solve spatiotemporal issues related to storage and processing. It also tends to offer better spatiotemporal data utilisation through the \"as-a-service\" paradigm. However, there is a difficulty in representing physical spatiotemporal phenomena that are continuous via the classical discrete based cloud approaches. This issue stems from the heterogeneity, dynamic scalability, and complex distributions of the spatiotemporal data.\n}\n\\section*{Reviewer \\#4}\nThe paper reviews the challenges and open problems in STDM. The challenges are categorized in 3 perspectives from general to specific tasks/applications. The table at the end of the paper summarizes the challenges together with related works attempting to address them which is helpful to researchers. \nHowever, it suffers from several nontrivial issues before it is ready to be published.\n\\newline\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Lack of background: \\newline\n    The paper first briefly introduces what is spatiotemporal data and then directly goes to the challenges of STDM, without necessary introduction on what is STDM and why it is important. It would be helpful to a section containing \n    basic concepts of spatiotemporal data mining \n    before heading into the analysis of the issues.\n    \\newline\n    \\textcolor{blue}{We updated the introduction section to provide background information on STDM including definitions, and research motivations and significance.\n    We explained the spatiotemporal data types from discrete and continuous measuring perspectives. We added illustrative figures for the correspondent data types. Besides, we highlighted the utilisation of STDM in different applications and scales. We explained some issues of classical data mining techniques that led to the need for STDM development. The text in Section 1 is updated as follows:\n    }\n    \\newline\n    \\newline\n\\textcolor{red}{\nLarge amounts of spatiotemporal data are being generated and captured through systems that record sequential observations of remote sensing, mobility, wearable devices, and social media. Spatiotemporal data represent different phenomena ranging from micro-scale of DNA and cell evolution, to global ones, e.g., climate change . The wide-availability of user-generated data via the social media platforms offers great opportunities to understand people needs, thoughts, and sentiments toward specific topics, products, or services . Medical sensory devices observe different activities at various locations of the human body over specific time ranges.\nSTDM proposes new methods to handle such data through advanced predictive and descriptive tasks such as classification and clustering to work best with space and time referenced data. \nSTDM methods are concerned with relationships and dependencies among different measurements. These relationships are complex, implicit, and dynamically changing.\nTo a large extent, classical data mining assumes that data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). On the contrast, spatiotemporal data do not follow this assumption and STDM methods aim to capture the autocorrelation among different events or data points that are interdisciplinary in nature, i.e, data from multiple domains that may require the utilisation of various mining tasks.\n\\newline\n\\newline\nSpatiotemporal data comprise spatial and temporal representations. They include three distinct types of attributes, namely, non-spatiotemporal, spatial and temporal attributes . The non-spatiotemporal attributes represent non-contextual features of objects. Spatial attributes define the locations, extents, and shapes of the objects. Temporal attributes are timestamps and durations of processes denoting spatial object (vector) or field (raster layers). For example, air pollution spatiotemporal data have non-spatiotemporal attributes such as air pollution levels or station names, spatial coordinates of the location where the measurements are taken and temporal timestamps associated with the collected measurements.\nSpatiotemporal data types can also be categorised based on their collection nature to discrete or continuous observations. Events and data trajectories are examples of spatiotemporal discrete data types, while continuous data types include point reference and raster data.\nSpatiotemporal event data constitute discrete events that happen at geo-locations and times such as traffic accidents and crime incidents. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (a) denotes spatiotemporal events of three different types. Each type is presented in different colour and shape, e.g., red circles are for events of one type and each event is annotated with the its location and time (location $l_1$ in time $t_1$).\nTrajectory data contain sequences of spatiotemporal instances that trace motions of objects in geographical spaces overtimes. Trajectories are usually represented by a series of chronologically ordered points which consist of spatial coordinates and timestamps . For instance, a vehicle trajectory between two locations is a set of consecutive points of space and time. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (b) illustrates trajectories of three coloured objects between locations ($l_1$ and $l_n$) at times ($t_1$ and $t_2$). \nPoint reference data measure continuous spatiotemporal fields at moving spatiotemporal reference sites. For example, spatiotemporal point references can be utilised to measure surface temperature using moving balloons. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (c and d) show spatiotemporal point reference data at different locations (black squares) at timestamps ($t_1$ and $t_2$).\nRaster data represent measurements of spatiotemporal fields at fixed cells in  grids such as activities in fMRI brain scans. Figure \\ref{ST_types} (e and f) show spatiotemporal raster data of regular grid at time ($t_1$ and $t_2$).\nThese different types of spatiotemporal data are associated with different research challenges . Classical data mining approaches are not designed to handle such data. \n\\begin{figure}[]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.99\\textwidth, angle=0]{ST-Data-2.jpg}\n\\caption{\\textcolor{red}{Spatiotemporal data types.
