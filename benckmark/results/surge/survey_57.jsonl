Among these models, the most popular ones include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)  , GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) v1-3 , RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training)  and T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) . The profound impact of Transformer models has become more clear with their scalability to very large capacity models . For example, the BERT-large  model with 340 million parameters was significantly outperformed by the  GPT-3~ model with 175 billion parameters while the latest mixture-of-experts Switch transformer  scales up to a whopping 1.6 trillion parameters!\n \\begin{figure*}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Figs/FieldGrowth.png}\n    \\vspace{-0.7cm}\n    \\caption{\\small Statistics on the number of times keywords such as BERT, Self-Attention, and Transformers appear in the titles of Peer-reviewed and arXiv papers over the past few years (in Computer Vision and Machine Learning).

However, visual data follows a typical structure (e.g., spatial and temporal coherence), thus demanding novel network designs and training schemes. As a result, Transformer models and their variants have been successfully used for image recognition , object detection , segmentation , image super-resolution , video understanding , image generation , text-image synthesis  and visual question answering , among several other use cases . This survey aims to cover such recent and exciting efforts in the computer vision domain, providing a comprehensive reference to interested readers. \nTransformer architectures are based on a self-attention mechanism that learns the relationships between elements of a sequence. As opposed to recurrent networks that process sequence elements recursively and can only attend to short-term context, Transformers can attend to complete sequences thereby learning long-range relationships. \n\\sk{Although attention models have been extensively used in both feed-forward and recurrent networks , Transformers are based solely on the attention mechanism and have a unique implementation (i.e., multi-head attention) optimized for parallelization.} An important feature of these models is their scalability to high-complexity models and large-scale datasets \\sk{e.g., in comparison to some of the other alternatives such as hard attention  which is stochastic in nature and requires Monte Carlo sampling for sampling attention locations.} \nSince Transformers assume minimal prior knowledge about the structure of the problem as compared to their convolutional and recurrent counterparts~,  they are typically pre-trained using pretext tasks on large-scale (unlabelled) datasets .  Such a pre-training avoids costly manual annotations, thereby encoding highly expressive and generalizable representations that model rich relationships between the entities present in a given dataset.  The learned representations are then fine-tuned on the downstream tasks in a supervised manner to obtain favorable results.  \nThis paper provides a holistic overview of the transformer models developed for computer vision applications. We develop a taxonomy of the network design space and highlight the major strengths and shortcomings of the existing methods. Other literature reviews mainly focus on the NLP domain  or cover generic attention-based approaches . By focusing on the newly emerging area of visual transformers, we comprehensively organize the recent approaches according to the intrinsic features of self-attention and the investigated task. We first provide an introduction to the salient concepts underlying Transformer networks and then elaborate on the specifics of recent vision transformers. \nWhere ever possible, we draw parallels between the Transformers used in the NLP domain  and the ones developed for vision problems to flash major novelties and interesting domain-specific insights.  \nRecent approaches show that convolution operations can be fully replaced with attention-based transformer modules and have also been used jointly in a single design to encourage symbiosis between the two complementary set of operations. \nThis survey finally details open research questions with an outlook towards the possible future work.", "cites": [679, 166, 4830, 7590, 7993, 707, 2012, 7360, 7302, 7070, 826, 5764, 38, 5762, 2635, 4829, 768, 7, 7373, 732, 728, 5763, 9, 8454, 4766, 5765], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7941176470588235, "origin_cites_number": 34, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes key concepts from multiple Transformer-related papers, especially in highlighting architectural differences and the role of attention mechanisms in both NLP and vision.

The self-attention mechanism is an integral component of Transformers, which explicitly models the interactions between all entities of a sequence for structured prediction tasks. Basically, a self-attention layer updates each component of a sequence by aggregating global information from the complete input sequence. \nLets denote a sequence of $n$ entities ($\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\cdots \\mathbf{x}_n$) by $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, where $d$ is the embedding dimension to represent each entity. The goal of self-attention is to capture the interaction amongst all $n$ entities by encoding each entity in terms of the global contextual information. This is done by defining three learnable weight matrices to transform Queries ($\\mathbf{W}^Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_q}$), Keys ($\\mathbf{W}^K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_k}$) and Values ($\\mathbf{W}^V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_v}$), where $d_q=d_k$. The input sequence $\\mathbf{X}$ is first projected onto these weight matrices to get $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}^Q$, $\\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}^K$ and $\\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}^V$. The output $\\mathbf{Z}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_v}$ of the self attention layer is,\n$$\\mathbf{Z}= \\mathbf{softmax}\\left (\\frac{\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{K}^T}{\\sqrt{d_q}}\\right )\\mathbf{V}.$$\nFor a given entity in the sequence, the self-attention basically computes the dot-product of the query with all keys, which is then normalized using softmax operator to get the attention scores. Each entity then becomes the weighted sum of all entities in the sequence, where weights are given by the attention scores (Fig.~\\ref{fig:self-attention} and Fig.~\\ref{fig:transformer}, top row-left block). \n\\textbf{Masked Self-Attention:} The standard self-attention layer attends to all entities. For the Transformer model  which is trained to predict the next entity of the sequence, the self-attention blocks used in the decoder are masked to prevent attending to the subsequent future entities. This is simply done by an element-wise multiplication operation with a mask $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, where $\\mathbf{M}$ is an upper-triangular matrix. The masked self-attention is defined by,  $$ \\mathbf{softmax}\\left (\\frac{\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{K}^T}{\\sqrt{d_q}} \\circ \\mathbf{M}\\right ),$$ where $\\circ$ denotes Hadamard product. Basically, while predicting an entity in the sequence, the attention scores of the future entities are set to zero in masked self-attention.\n\\textbf{Multi-Head Attention:}\nIn order to encapsulate multiple complex relationships amongst different elements in the sequence, the multi-head attention comprises multiple self-attention blocks ($h=8$ in the original Transformer model ). Each block has its own set of learnable weight matrices $\\{\\mathbf{W}^{Q_i},\\mathbf{W}^{K_i},\\mathbf{W}^{V_i} \\}$, where $i=0 \\cdots (h{-}1)$. For an input $\\mathbf{X}$, the output of the $h$ self-attention blocks in multi-head attention is then concatenated into a single matrix $[\\mathbf{Z}_0,\\mathbf{Z}_1,\\cdots\\mathbf{Z}_{h-1}] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times h \\cdot d_v}$ and projected onto a weight matrix $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\cdot d_v \\times d}$ (Fig.~\\ref{fig:transformer}, top row).\nThe main difference of self-attention with convolution operation is that the filters are dynamically calculated instead of static filters (that stay the same for any input) as in the case of convolution. Further, self-attention is invariant to permutations and changes in the number of input points. \\sk{As a result, it can easily operate on irregular inputs as opposed to standard convolution that requires grid structure. Furthermore, it has been shown in the literature how self-attention (with positional encodings) is theoretically a more flexible operation which can model the behaviour of convolutional models towards encoding local features . Cordonnier \\etal  further studied the relationships between self-attention and convolution operations. Their empirical results confirm that multi-head self-attention (with sufficient parameters) is a more generic operation which can model the expressiveness of convolution as a special case. In fact, self-attention provides the capability to learn the global as well as local features, and provide expressivity to adaptively learn kernel weights as well as the receptive field (similar to deformable convolutions ).}", "cites": [5766, 7994, 722, 38], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section provides a clear and insightful explanation of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers, integrating key concepts from multiple cited papers to highlight its flexibility and expressiveness.

The critical analysis is evident in the evaluation of self-attention as a more generic and adaptive mechanism compared to fixed filters in convolutions. The abstraction is strong, as it generalizes self-attention as a permutation-invariant and input-flexible operation."}}

First, pre-training is performed on a large-scale dataset (and sometimes a combination of several available datasets ) in either a supervised   or a \\sk{self-supervised manner} . Later, the pre-trained weights are adapted to the down-stream tasks using small-mid scale datasets. Examples of downstream tasks include image classification , object detection , \\sk{zero-shot classification} , question-answering  and action recognition . The effectiveness of pre-training for large-scale Transformers has been advocated in both the language and vision domains. For example, Vision Transformer model (ViT-L)  experiences an absolute $13\\%$ drop in accuracy on ImageNet test set when trained only on ImageNet train set as compared to the case when pretrained on JFT dataset  with 300 million images.\nSince acquiring manual labels at a massive scale is cumbersome, self-supervised learning has been very effectively used in the pre-training stage.  The self-supervision based pre-training stage training has played a crucial role in unleashing the scalability and generalization of Transformer networks, enabling training even above a \\emph{trillion} parameter networks (e.g., the latest Switch Transformer  from Google). \nAn extensive survey on SSL can be found in . As nicely summarized by Y.~LeCun , the basic idea of SSL is to \\emph{fill in the blanks}, i.e., try to predict the occluded data in images, future or past frames in temporal video sequences or predict a pretext task \\eg, the amount of rotation applied to inputs, the permutation applied to image patches or the color of a gray-scale image. Another effective way to impose self-supervised constraints is via contrastive learning. In this case, nuisance transformations are used to create two types of modified versions of the same image i.e.,  without changing the underlying class semantics (\\eg, image stylizing, cropping) and with semantic changes (\\eg, replacing an object with another in the same scene, or changing the class with minor adversarial changes to the image). Subsequently, the model is trained to be invariant to the nuisance transformations and emphasize on modeling minor changes that can alter semantic labels. \nSelf-supervised learning provides a promising learning paradigm since it enables learning from a vast amount of readily available non-annotated data. In the SSL based pre-training stage, a model is trained to learn a meaningful representation of the underlying data by solving a pretext task. The pseudo-labels for the pretext task are automatically generated (without requiring any expensive manual annotations) based on data attributes and task definition. Therefore, the pretext task definition is a critical choice in SSL. We can broadly categorize existing SSL methods based upon their pretext tasks into \\textbf{(a)} \\textit{generative} approaches which synthesize images or videos (given conditional inputs), \\textbf{(b)} \\textit{context-based} methods which exploit the relationships between image patches or video frames, and \\textbf{(c)} \\textit{cross-modal} methods which leverage from multiple data modalities. Examples of \\textit{generative} approaches include conditional generation tasks such as masked image modeling  and image colorization , image super-resolution , image in-painting , and GANs based methods . The \\textit{context-based} pretext methods solve problems such as a jigsaw puzzle on image patches , masked object classification , predict geometric transformation such as rotation , or verify temporal sequence of video frames .

Residual connections  alongside layer normalization  are employed after each block as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:transformer}. Note that, different from regular convolutional networks where feature aggregation and feature transformation are simultaneously performed (\\eg, with a convolution layer followed by a non-linearity), these two steps are decoupled in the Transformer model i.e., self-attention layer only performs aggregation while the feed-forward layer performs transformation.\nSimilar to the encoder, the decoder (\\emph{bottom} row) in the Transformer model comprises six identical blocks.

This way, the non-local operation is able to capture interactions between any two positions in the feature map regardless of the distance between them.

The local relation layer belongs to the category of bottom-up methods but it is restricted to a fixed window size  \\eg, 7x7 neighborhood.\nBello \\etal~ explore the possibility of employing self-attention as an alternative to convolutional operators.

On the other hand, global attention  which attend to all spatial locations of the input can be computationally intensive and is preferred on down-sampled small images,  image patches  or augmenting the convolutional features space . Ramachandran \\etal    proposed to replace convolutional layers in deep neural networks with a local self-attention layer which can be applied to small or large inputs without increasing the computational cost. At a basic level, the proposed self-attention layer  considers all pixel positions in a specific window size around a given pixel, compute queries, keys and value vectors for these pixels, and then aggregates the spatial information within this window. The value vectors are aggregated after projecting the softmax score of queries and keys. This process is repeated for all given pixels and the response is concatenated to produce the output pixel. ResNet models with local self-attention layer can solve ImageNet and COCO object detection with fewer parameters as compared to ResNet models based on convolutional layers .\nZhao \\etal  note that a traditional convolution operator performs feature aggregation and transformation jointly (by applying a filter and then passing it through a non-linearity). In contrast, they propose to perform feature aggregation separately with self-attention followed by transformation using an element-wise perceptron layer. \nFor feature aggregation, they propose two alternate strategies: (a) pairwise self-attention and (b) patch-wise self-attention. The pairwise self-attention is permutation and cardinality invariant operation, while the patch-wise self-attention does not have such invariance properties (similar to convolution). Both pairwise and patch-wise self-attentions are implemented as a \\emph{vector} attention  that learns weights for both the spatial and channel dimensions. This provides an alternate approach for attention that is conventionally performed using scalar weights (by taking a dot-product). The pairwise self-attention is a set operator that computes a \\emph{vector attention} keeping in view the relationships of a particular feature with its neighbors in a given local neighborhood. In contrast, patch-wise self-attention is a generalization of the convolution operator (not a set operator) and looks at all the feature vectors in the local neighbourhood when deriving the attention vectors.

We name such models as the uniform-scale ViTs, as described below.}\nVision Transformer (ViT)  (Fig.~\\ref{fig:vision_transformer}) is the first work to showcase how Transformers can `altogether' replace standard convolutions in deep neural networks on large-scale image datasets. They applied the original Transformer model  (with minimal changes) on a sequence of image 'patches' flattend as vectors. The model was pre-trained on a large propriety dataset (JFT dataset  with 300 million images) and then fine-tuned to downstream recognition benchmarks \\eg, ImageNet classification. This is an important step since pre-training ViT on a medium-range dataset would not give competitive results, because the CNNs encode prior knowledge about the images (inductive biases \\eg, translation equivariance) that reduces the need of data as compared to Transformers which must discover such information from very large-scale data. Notably, compared to the iGPT  model that also applied Transformers to full-sized images but performs training as a generative task, ViT pre-trains the model with a supervised classification task (although a self-supervision variant is also explored which results in a less performance). \n \\begin{figure}[]\n     \\centering\n     \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{Figs/VisionTransformer.pdf}\n     \\caption{\\small An overview of Vision Transformer (on the \\emph{left}) and the details of Transformer encoder (on the \\emph{right}).

Image obtained from . }\n     \\label{fig:vision_transformer}\n \\end{figure}\nThe DeiT  is the first work to demonstrate that Transformers can be learned on mid-sized datasets (i.e., 1.2 million ImageNet examples compared to 300 million images of JFT  used in ViT ) in relatively shorter training episodes. \nBesides using augmentation and regularization procedures common in CNNs, the main contribution of DeiT  is a novel native distillation approach for Transformers which uses a CNN as a teacher model (RegNetY-16GF ) to train the Transformer model. The outputs from the CNN aid the Transformer in efficiently figuring out useful representations for input images. A distillation token is appended with the input patch embeddings and the class token. The self-attention layers operate on these tokens to learn their inter-dependencies and outputs the learned class, patch, and distillation tokens. The network is trained with a cross-entropy loss defined on the output class token and a distillation loss to match the distillation token with the teacher output. Both \\emph{soft} and \\emph{hard} label choices were explored for distillation, where the hard distillation was found to perform better. Interestingly, the learned class and distillation tokens do not exhibit a high correlation indicating their complementary nature. The learned representations compare favorably well against top-performing CNN architectures such as EfficientNet  and also generalize well for a number of downstream recognition tasks.\nToken to Token (T2T) ViT  recursively combines neighboring tokens into a single token to reduce tokens length and aggregate spatial context. Transformer in Transformer  computes attention at two levels: patch-level (as done is standard ViTs ) and local sub-patch-level (\\eg by subdividing a $16\\times16$ patch into four $4\\times4$ blocks, and computing attention amongst these blocks). \nIn token labelling ViT , all patch tokens contribute towards loss calculation, different from regular ViTs that only use classification token in the loss. This process includes auxiliary supervision where each image-patch (token) is labeled using a pre-trained CNN model. Similar to CutMix augmentation , tokens from different images are mixed as an augmentation strategy, and the model is trained using the standard classification loss and auxiliary token-label loss. Their model demonstrates excellent performance specially for smaller sized models.\nThe quadratic complexity of self-attention hinders its applicability to longer sequences (high-resolution images). Cross-Covariance Image Transformers (XCiT)  incorporate attention across feature-channels instead of tokens, i.e., their cross-covariance attention is given by $\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{softmax}\\left (\\frac{\\mathbf{K}^T \\mathbf{Q}^T}{\\sqrt{\\tau}}\\right )$. The proposed cross-covariance attention has linear complexity (since it depends upon feature dimension instead of the number of tokens). XCiT can therefore handle large resolution images and demonstrate excellent performance across different vision tasks i.e., self-supervised and fully supervised image classification and dense prediction (detection, segmentation). DeepViT  observes that the similarity between attention maps of deeper layer is high and hinders scaling models depth. They propose to re-attend the attention maps in a multi-head block instead of simple aggregation of these attention maps, and show consistent gains over standard multi-head self attention based ViTs.", "cites": [7367, 4789, 7167, 2579, 7070, 107, 2519, 7590, 4782, 8950, 732, 38], "cite_extract_rate": 0.9230769230769231, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple Vision Transformer variants, linking their design choices (e.g., distillation, token labeling, attention computation) to address common challenges like data efficiency, resolution scalability, and depth limitations.

This is limiting, since the model is unable to capture fine spatial details at different scales. Initial Transformer based dense prediction methods (e.g., DETR ) therefore have a convolutional backend. Multi-stage hierarchical design for ViTs, where number of tokens is gradually reduced while the token feature dimension is  progressively increased, has been shown to produce effective features for dense prediction tasks . These models generally also perform well for recognition tasks. These architectures mostly sparsify tokens by merging neighboring tokens and projecting them to a higher dimensional feature space. Examples of multi-stage ViTs include Pyramid ViT , Twins , CoaT , Swin Transformer , Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) , Shuffle Transformer , CrossFormer , RegionViT  and Focal Transformer models . Some of them are hybrid designs (with both convolution and self-attention operations, see Sec.~\\ref{Hybrid ViTs with Convolutions}), while others only employ pure self-attention based design (discussed next).\nPyramid ViT (PVT)  is the first hierarchical design for ViT, and proposes a progressive shrinking pyramid and spatial-reduction attention. PVTv2  and SegFormer  improve original PVT  by introducing overlapping patch embedding, depth-wise convolution, and efficient attention. Swin Transformer  has a multi-stage hierarchical architecture which computes attention within a local window, by partitioning the window into multiple sub-patches. To capture interactions between different windows (image locations), window partitioning is gradually shifted, along the hierarchy of the network, to capture overlapping regions. \nFocal Transformer models  is another hierarchical design, where focal self-attention is introduced to simultaneously capture global and local relationships.\nSimilarly, CrossFormer   has a hierarchical pyramid structure, and introduces cross-scale embedding module, along-with long short distance attention and dynamic position bias to faithfully capture both local and global visual cues.  RegionViT  proposes a regional-to-local attention to encode hierarchical features. Multi-Scale Vision Longformer  also considers a local context in self-attention, but employs the efficient Longformer  design for self-attention.

For example, Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT)  incorporate convolution based projection to capture the spatial structure and low-level details, for tokenization of image patches. CvT has a hierarchical design, where number of tokens is progressively reduced while the token-width is increased, thus imitating the impact of spatial downsampling as in CNNs. Convolution enhanced image Transformers  employ convolutions based image-to-token module to extract low-level features. Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT)  introduces a new sequence pooling scheme, and incorporates convolutional blocks (conv-pool-reshape) for tokenization. CCT can be trained from scratch on smaller datasets, \\eg, CIFAR10 with $\\sim95\\%$ accuracy, which is a remarkable property not possible with the traditional ViTs. \nLocalViT  introduces depthwise convolutions to enhance local features modeling capability of ViTs. LeViT  (name inspired from LeNet ) applies a four-layered CNN block (with $3\\times3$ convolutions) at the beginning with progressively increasing channels (3,32,64,128,256). For a $3\\times224\\times224$ input image, the resulting $256\\times14\\times14$ output from the CNN block becomes input to a hierarchical ViT. By virtue of its design, LeViT is $5\\times$ faster than EfficientNet  on CPU, at inference. ResT  is another hierarchical architecture which applies a CNN block at the beginning for patch-embedding. It incorporates depth-wise convolutions and adaptive position encoding to tackle varying image sizes. A recent approach NesT  proposes a simple technique to introduce hierarchy in ViTs. NesT divides an image into non-overlapping blocks (each block is further split into patches). It first separately applies local self-attention on patches within each block, and then enables global interaction between blocks by aggregating them into an image space and applying convolution operation, followed by downsampling. The number of blocks is gradually reduced along the hierarchy of the model, while number of local-patches is kept fixed. This simple scheme performs favorably compared with more sophisticated designs , and enables training NesT on smaller datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) from scratch.\nDepthwise Convolution and self-Attention Networks (CoAtNets)  introduce a relative attention module (which combines depthwise convolutions and self-attention), and vertically stack convolution and attention layers. CoAtNets demonstrate an impressive $86\\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy without extra data (i.e. trained only on ImageNet-1k). Shuffle Transformer  performs self-attention within a window and has depth-wise convolutions between the window-based multi-head self-attention and MLP. It introduces a shuffle operation to build stronger cross-patch connections. \nCo-scale conv-attentional image Transformers (CoaT) , is a hybrid hierarchical pyramid design, with serial and parallel blocks, where the serial block is similar to standard transformer block except for the attention layer replaced with depthwise convolution. The parallel blocks is applied on the output of serial blocks and encodes relationships between tokens at multiple scales using cross-attention. \nTwins  builds upon PVT  (an attention only pyramid design), by replacing the absolute position embedding in PVT with relative conditional position embedding , and incorporating the separable depth-wise convolutions instead of the standard spatial attention, to capture local and global context of the image. In this sense, the hybrid designs tend to combine the strengths of both convolution and transformer models.

The Transformer model enables the prediction of a set of objects (in a single shot) and also allows modeling their relationships. DETR adapts a set loss function which allows bipartite matching between predictions and ground-truth boxes. The main advantage of DETR is that it removes the dependence on hand-crafted modules and operations, such as the RPN (region proposal network) and NMS (non-maximal suppression) commonly used in object detection . In this manner, the dependence on prior knowledge and careful engineering design is relaxed for complex structured tasks like object detection. \n\\begin{figure}[]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Figs/DETR.png}\n    \\vspace{-0.3cm}\n    \\caption{\\small Detection Transformer (DETR)  treats the object detection task as a set prediction problem and uses the Transformer network to encode relationships between set elements. A bipartite set loss is used to uniquely match the box predictions with the ground-truth boxes (shown on the \\emph{right} two columns). In case of no match, a '\\emph{no object}' class prediction is selected. Its simple design with minimal problem-specific modifications can beat a carefully built and popular Faster R-CNN model. Figure from .}\n    \\label{fig:detr}\n\\end{figure}\nGiven spatial feature maps from the CNN backbone, the encoder first flattens the spatial dimensions (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:detr}). This gives a sequence of features $d\\times n$, where $d$ is the feature dimension and $n = h\\times w$ with $h, w$ being the height and width of the spatial feature maps. These features are then encoded and decoded using multi-head self-attention modules as in . The main difference in the decoding stage is that all boxes are predicted in parallel while  uses an RNN to predict sequence elements one by one. Since the encoder and decoder are permutation invariant, learned positional encodings are used as  the object queries by the decoder to generate different boxes. Note that the spatial structure in a CNN detector (e.g., Faster R-CNN) automatically encodes the positional information. DETR obtains performance comparable to the popular Faster R-CNN model  which is an impressive feat given its simple design. The DETR has also been extended to interesting applications in other domains, e.g., Cell-DETR  extends it for instance segmentation of biological cells. A dedicated attention branch is added to obtain instance-wise segmentations in addition box predictions that are enhanced with a CNN decoder to generate accurate instance masks.\nThe DETR  model successfully combines convolutional networks with Transformers  to remove hand-crafted design requirements and achieves an end-to-end trainable object detection pipeline. However, it struggles to detect small objects and suffers from slow convergence and a relatively high computational cost . DETR maps images to features space before using the Transformer for the relation modeling. Thus, the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with the spatial size of the feature map i.e.,  $\\mathcal{O}(H^2W^2C)$, where $H$ and $W$ represent the height and width of the feature map. This inherently puts a limitation on the use of multi-scale hierarchical features  in DETR training framework which is ultimately important to detect small objects. Furthermore, at the beginning of training, the attention module simply projects uniform attention to all the locations of the feature map and requires a large number of training epochs to tune attention weights to converge to meaningfully sparse locations. This approach contributes to a slow convergence rate of DETR. To mitigate the above-mentioned issues,  proposed a deformable attention module to process the feature maps. Inspired from deformable convolutions , deformable attention module  only attends to sparse set of elements from the whole feature map regardless of its spatial size.

Below, we discuss axial self-attention  , a cross-modal approach  that can segment regions corresponding to a given language expression, and ViTs based segmentation architectures .\nPanoptic segmentation~ aims to jointly solve the otherwise distinct tasks of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation by assigning each pixel a semantic label and an instance id. Global context can provide useful cues to deal with such a complex visual understanding task. Self-attention is effective at modeling long-range contextual information, albeit applying it to large inputs for a dense prediction task like panoptic segmentation is prohibitively expensive.  A naive solution is to apply self-attention either to downsampled inputs or to limited regions around each pixel~. Even after introducing these constraints, the self-attention still has quadratic complexity and sacrifices the global context.\nTo tackle these issues, Wang \\etal~ propose the position-sensitive axial-attention where the 2D self-attention mechanism is reformulated as two 1D axial-attention layers, applied to height-axis and width-axis sequentially (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:axial_attention}). The axial-attention is compute efficient and enables models to capture the full-image context. It achieves competitive performance for the panoptic segmentation task on COCO~, Mapillary Vistas~, and Cityscapes~ benchmarks and for the image classification on ImageNet dataset~. \nCross-modal Self-attention (CMSA)  encodes long-range multi-modal dependencies between linguistic and visual features for \\textit{referring image segmentation task}, that aims to segment entities in an image referred by a language description.\nFor this purpose, a set of cross-modal features is obtained by concatenating image features with each word embedding and the spatial coordinate features. The self-attention operates on these features and generates attention over the image corresponding to each word in the sentence. The segmentation network then performs self-attention at multiple spatial levels and uses a gated multi-level fusion module to refine segmentation masks via information exchange across multi-resolution features. A binary CE loss is used to train the overall model that achieves good improvements on UNC , G-Ref  and ReferIt  datasets.\n\\mh{\nWhile the segmentation approaches discussed above insert self-attention in their CNN based architectures, some recent works have proposed transformer based encoder-decoder architectures.

Their approach models the joint distribution of the image pixels by factorizing it as a product of pixel-wise conditional distributions. Previously developed auto-regressive models for this task, such as the PixelCNN~, suffer from a limited receptive field which hinders in modeling long term relationships in an image \\eg, part relationships or occlusions. Using self-attention,   enhances the receptive field without incurring a high computational cost (\\eg, effective receptive field up to 256 pixels can be achieved as compared to 25 pixels of PixelCNN~). The generative pipeline was also tested on conditional generation tasks \\eg, image super-resolution, image completion, and denoising.\n \\begin{figure}[]\n     \\centering\n     \\includegraphics[clip=true, trim=0mm 0mm 1mm 2.0mm, width=1\\columnwidth]{Figs/ImageTransformer.png}\n     \\caption{\\small (a) Self-attention block in Image Transformer .

Specifically, iGPT trains GPT v2 model  on flattened image sequences (1D pixel arrays) and shows that it can generate plausible image outputs without any external supervision. The generated samples depict the model's ability to understand spatial relationships between pixels and high-level attributes such as object classes, texture, and scale. Notably, the design does not use any image-specific knowledge in the design (e.g., the 2D position embeddings used in Image Transformer ).\nThe features learned with iGPT's unsupervised training mechanism compete impressively against other unsupervised approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10/100  and STL  datasets while performing comparably to SimCLR (a contrastive learning approach)  on ImageNet dataset. This is an astounding result, since the iGPT architecture is exactly the same as used for language modeling tasks, and therefore it does not incorporate any prior domain-specific knowledge. Notably, the competing unsupervised CNN based solutions widely adopt such priors in the form of architectural design, attention mechanisms, loss functions, and regularization . However, on the downside, iGPT has a high compute cost \\eg, iGPT-L version has roughly $36\\times$ high training cost compared to MoCo  which is a state of the art self-supervised feature learning approach. For this reason, the training was generally limited to low-resolution of $\\leq 64\\times 64$, while convolutional architectures can effectively learn from high-resolution inputs.\nTransformers typically incur a high compute cost when applied on high-dimensional sequences. To overcome this limitation, Esser \\etal  proposed to include inductive biases (commonly used in the CNNs) alongside Transformers to improve their efficiency. Specifically, local connectivity and spatial invariance biases inbuilt in the CNN structure are leveraged by learning a rich dictionary of visual patterns (using a Generative Adversarial approach). A Transformer is then used to learn the long-range interactions between the dictionary items to generate the outputs. In turn, they develop a conditional image generation model capable of producing very high-resolution images (up to megapixel range) using Transformers. This is the first work that demonstrates the application of Transformers to generate such high-resolution images.  \nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  with CNNs as default backbone have been very successful for visually appealing image synthesis . TransGAN  builds a strong GAN model, free of any convolution operation, with both generator and discriminator based upon the Transformer model . \nThe architecture of both generator and discriminator is based upon the encoder in original Transformer model . For memory efficiency, the generator contains multiple stages, with up-sampling modules in-between, which gradually increase the resolution of feature maps (input sequence length) while reducing the embedding dimension. The discriminator of TransGAN takes flattened image-patches as tokens similar to .\nAuthors introduce different training techniques including data augmentation, training with an auxiliary task and injecting locality to self-attention to scale-up their model for high quality image synthesis . The TransGAN model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of Inception Score and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) on STL-10 and performs favorably compared with their CNN-based GAN counterparts on other datasets. \n Unlike previous image generation methods , which directly predict image outputs,   learns to generate parameters of 3D objects to be placed in a given scene. Specifically, SceneFormer  studies the 3D room layout conditioned scene generation task. Given the empty room shape,   can propose new object configurations in the room while maintaining realism. Remarkably, the model does not use any appearance information and only learns to generate new scenes by modeling the inter-object relationships using self-attention in Transformers. Similar to how a Transformer operates on a sentence, it is applied to a sequence of objects to predict the next suitable object in a scene. Specifically, the size, pose, location, and category of the next object is predicted by the Transformer model. A start token indicates the initiation of inference and the number of output token indicate the objects generated by the model in a sequence. The authors also explore generating new scenes given a textual description of the room layout. The independence from the appearance makes the approach efficient, enabling interactive scene generation.  \nThe task of generating realistic images from text is interesting and practically valuable (\\eg, for artistic content creation), but at the same time highly challenging. Prior text-to-image synthesis approaches~ are mostly based on GANs~. Although these methods produce encouraging results, they are far from being photo-realistic. \nRamesh~\\etal~ recently proposed DALL·E which is a Transformer model capable of generating high-fidelity images from a given text description. \nDALL·E model has 12 billion parameters and it is trained on a large set of text-image pairs taken from the internet. \nBefore training, images are first resized to 256$\\times$256 resolution, and subsequently compressed to a 32$\\times$32 grid of latent codes using a pre-trained discrete variational autoencoder~. \nDALL·E takes as input a single stream of 1280 tokens (256 for the text and 1024 for the image), and is trained to generate all other tokens autoregressively (one after another).

It is a one-to-many task as for a given grayscale input, there exist many possibilities in the colorized output space. The challenging nature of this task requires probabilistic models capable of producing multiple colorized output samples. Colorization Transformer  is a probabilistic model based on conditional attention mechanism . It divides the image colorization task into three sub-problems \nand proposes to solve each task sequentially by a different Transformer network. The authors first train a Transformer network to map a low-resolution grey-scale image to a 3-bit low-resolution colored image. Low-resolution images in turn allow training of larger models. The 3-bit low-resolution colored image is then upsampled to an 8-bit RGB sample by another Transformer network in the second stage of training. Finally, a third stage Transformer is trained to increase the spatial resolution of the 8-bit RGB sample produced by the second-stage Transformer. Self-attention used in the colorization Transformer is based on row/column attention layers introduced in . These layers capture the interaction between each pixel of an input image while being computationally less costly. The row-wise attention layer applies self-attention to all pixels in a given row, while the column-wise attention layer considers pixels only in a given column of an image.

The goal was to learn representations that can jointly model images and natural language. For this purpose, ViLBERT developed a two-stream architecture where each stream is dedicated to model the vision or language inputs (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-h). The architecture of both parallel streams is a series of Transformer blocks similar to the BERT model. Subsequently, co-attentional Transformer layers are applied to learn cross-modal relationships. The co-attentional framework is very simple. Query, key, and value matrices are computed for each modality in the standard way  and then key-value pairs for one modality are passed on to the other modality's attention head. \nViLBERT applies VLP on a set of proxy tasks defined on the Conceptual Concepts dataset (with 3.3M images with weak captions) and later fine-tune the model on downstream tasks such as VQA. The pre-training phase operates in a self-supervised manner, i.e., pretext tasks are created without manual labeling on the large-scale unlabelled dataset. These pretext tasks include predicting whether the text and image inputs are related and predicting the semantics of masked image regions and textual inputs (\\eg, similar to reconstructing masked words in text in the BERT model ). This way, the model learns the inherent structure in the data during pre-training and also models cross-domain associations. With evaluations on several tasks,  demonstrated that a two-stream model can perform better than a single-stream model that uses shared parameters to model both language and vision domains .\nSimilar to ViLBERT , Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers (LXMERT)  also uses a two-stream architecture based on BERT framework. The main difference lies in the object-relationship encoder that is used to model the visual features instead of simple image-level features used in ViLBERT. The information in two streams is then fused across modalities using cross-attention blocks similar to .\nCompared to two pre-texts tasks used for VLP in , LXMERT uses five pre-training tasks including masked object and language prediction, cross-modality matching, and visual question answering (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-g). The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the VQA task, however, a high similarity between pre-training and fine-tuned tasks raises questions on the generalizability of the learned representations to new tasks. To this end, the authors conducted generalization experiments on Visual Reasoning for Real (NLVR) task  demonstrating impressive improvements on novel tasks. \nLee \\etal\n note that the multi-modal representation learning approaches like VideoBERT  and ViLBERT  generally keep the language processing part fixed to a pre-trained model (\\eg, BERT ) to reduce training complexity.  For the first time in the literature, they propose to learn an end-to-end multi-modal bidirectional Transformer model called PEMT on audio-visual data from unlabeled videos.  First, short-term (\\eg, 1-3 seconds) video dynamics are encoded using CNNs, followed by a modality-specific Transformer (audio/visual) to model long-term dependencies (\\eg, 30 seconds). A multi-modal Transformer is then applied to the modality-specific Transformer outputs to exchange information across visual-linguistic domains. However, learning such a model in a naive form would incur huge memory requirements. To reduce parametric complexity, the parameters are shared across layers within each Transformer which leads upto 80\\% parameter reduction.\nThe Transformer is trained using a contrastive learning approach based on a content-aware negative sampling (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-i).  Specifically, the model uses the features obtained from CNNs learned during the training phase to select negative samples that are visually similar to the positive instances. This work also compares various fusion strategies adopted in earlier works such as early (VideoBERT  and VL-BERT ), mid-level (ViL-BERT  and  LXMERT ) and late fusion mechanisms and shows that the mid-level fusion is the optimal choice. The proposed model is pre-trained on Kinetics-700  dataset and later fine-tuned on downstream video classification tasks such as short video classification on UCF101 , audio classification on ESC50  and long-term action recognition on Charades  and Kinetics-Sounds  datasets.\nTan and Bansal\n introduce the concept of `\\emph{vokens}' (images related to language tokens extracted from sentences). The vokens (visualized tokens) provide visual supervision to the language model to learn better features. The motivation is that humans learn languages by correlating visual information with semantic concepts. In a similar spirit to other self-supervised language representation learning methods , they learn representations by defining an auxiliary task of voken-prediction task.\nSince the existing datasets encode limited visually grounded tokens, they propose a vokenization method to map language tokens to visual vokens, as illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:voken}. \nThe approach uses language-based retrieval for such a mapping and transfers a model trained on a small labeled dataset (MS-COCO) to a large dataset (Wikipedia). Furthermore, it was ensured that the sentence-wide context is considered to obtain the token-voken mapping. The resulting model trained using generated tokens outperforms the state of the art BERT model on a diverse set of NLP tasks. In this sense, the proposed model does not evaluate vision tasks, however, uses vision as a useful grounding cue to train the language model, hence we include it in the multi-modal representation learning group. \nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to predict a navigation plan on a map based on the vision and language inputs. Transformer models were used earlier in \n for VLN task. These works first pre-train a cross-modal Transformer using self-supervision on vision and language pairs and subsequently fine-tune on the specific VLN tasks. While these works learn attention between image region and language, Chen \\etal  propose to learn cross-modal attention between language inputs and spatial topological maps (to represent an agent's environment as a graph whose nodes denote places and the edges denote their connectivity). Given the topological map and natural language inputs, a VLN task using the Transformer model bears resemblance to sequence prediction in NLP. Specifically, at each time instance, the cross-modal Transformer predicts a single node of the topological map in the navigation plan. The individual language and map encodings are first processed using uni-modal encoders and later a cross-modal encoder (similar to LXMERT ) is applied to aggregate information across modalities. To denote positions in the map, a learned trajectory position encoding is appended with the map features. Based on this Transformer setup,  reports a full navigation system that can freely explore the environment and intelligently plan its actions. \n\\mh{\nCLIP  is a contrastive approach to learn image representations from text, with a learning objective which maximizes similarity of correct text-image pairs embeddings in a large batch size. Specifically, given a batch of $N$ image-text pairs, CLIP learns a multi-modal embedding space, by jointly training an image-encoder and a text-encoder, such that the cosine similarity of the valid $N$ image-text pairs is maximized, while the remaining $N^2-N$ pairs is minimized. The authors consider ResNet-50  and Vision Transformer (ViT)  for encoding images. The modified Transformer model  as in  is employed for encoding text. CLIP is trained on a large corpus of 400 million image-text pairs\nand demonstrates excellent zero-shot transfer capabilities. At inference, the names of classes are used as input to the text-encoder, and similarity of the encoded image is computed with all encoded texts (classes) to find the image-text pair with highest match. The CLIP achieves an astounding zero-shot classification accuracy of 75\\% on ImageNet, without using an supervision from ImageNet training set. The authors further demonstrate zero-shot transfer capabilities of the CLIP model on 30 different computer vision benchmarks. Note that\nCLIP with ResNet took 18 days to train on 592 V100 GPUs while CLIP with ViT took 12 days on 256 V100 GPUs.

The input sequence of text (\\eg, caption) and the visual features corresponding to the object proposals are fed to the Transformer that automatically discovers relations between the two domains. Notably, VisualBERT architecture is somewhat similar to VideoBERT  (explained in Sec.~\\ref{sec:video}), but instead of only focusing on cooking videos, VisualBERT evaluates on various visual-linguistic tasks (\\eg, VCR, NLVR, VQA, and visual grounding). \nThe VisualBERT model first applies task-agnostic pre-training using two objectives (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-e). The first objective simply attempts to predict missing text tokens using the image features and remaining textual tokens. The second objective attempts to differentiate between the true and false caption of a given image. After task-agnostic pre-training, the authors propose to perform task-specific pre-training to bridge the domain gap before the final fine-tuning to the downstream task. \nSu \\etal  propose a multi-modal pre-training approach to learn features that are generalizable to multi-modal downstream tasks such as Visual Commonsense Reasoning and Visual Question Answering. This endeavor requires adequately aligning the visual and linguistic cues so that an effective composite representation is learned. To the end,  builds on the BERT model and inputs both the visual and language features. The language features correspond to the token in the input sentence and the visual features correspond to the region of interest (RoI) from the input image (obtained via a standard Faster R-CNN). \nSpecifically, the model is pre-trained on both the visual-lingual dataset (Conceptual Captions ) as well as the language-only datasets (\\eg, Wikipedia). The loss function is identical to BERT, where the model is trained to predict the masked out words or visual ROIs (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-f). In contrary to other works such as UNITER , VL-BERT claims that the visual-linguistic matching tasks are not useful during pre-training, which is in contrast to evidence from later efforts . Their results on several multi-modal tasks show their benefit over the language-only pre-training (\\eg, in BERT).\nUniversal Encoder for Vision and Language (Unicoder-VL)  learns multi-modal representations using large-scale image-caption pairs. The language and image inputs are fed to a single Transformer model (with multiple successive encoders) to learn joint embeddings. To this end, it uses masked word prediction, masked object classification, and visual-linguistic matching as self-supervision tasks during pre-training (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-d). Notably, the visual-linguistic matching is carried out only at the global level (i.e., image-sentence alignment). The model is evaluated on image-text retrieval, zero-shot learning, and visual commonsense reasoning where it performs better than the previous models such as ViLBERT  and VisualBERT . This shows the significance of rich self-supervised tasks and advocates for a unified Transformer architecture to learn multi-modal features in a common framework. \nThe Unified Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP)  model uses a single Transformer network for both encoding and decoding stages. This stands in contrast to BERT inspired VLP models  which use independent encoder and decoder networks.\nJoint modeling of encoding and decoding stages allows the Unified VLP model to perform well for both image captioning and visual-question answering tasks, when fine-tuned on these individual tasks. \nThe intuition for shared modeling of encoding and decoding stage stems from the need to better share cross-task information during pre-training. The unified model consists of a stack of 12 Transformer blocks, each with a self-attention layer followed by a feed-forward module.\nThe self-supervised objectives used for pre-training include masked vision-language predictions. Here, the authors explore two variants i.e., bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence prediction of masked works where different context encodings are used for both types of objectives. \nThe proposed approach is evaluated on COCO Captions, Flick 30K Captions and VQA 2.0 and obtains encouraging results compared to previous methods on image captioning and VQA .  \nUniversal image-text representation (UNITER)  performs pre-training on four large-scale visual-linguistic datasets (MS-COCO , Visual Genome , Conceptual Captions  and SBU Captions ). The learned representations transfer well on downstream tasks such as VQA, Multi-modal retrieval, Visual Commonsense reasoning, and NLVR. In order to emphasize on learning the relationships between visual and language domains,  specifically designs pre-training tasks to predict masked visual or text region conditioned on the other domain input, and align language and visual inputs on both the global (image-text) and local (word-region) levels (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-a). These tasks are beside the conventional masked language modeling task used in BERT and explicitly include fine-grained word-region alignment alongside conditional masking of inputs that were not considered in the earlier works such as VL-BERT , Visual-BERT , Vilbert  and Unicoder-VL . Common to the other approaches, they adopt the Transformer architecture proposed in BERT that operates on both the visual and language embeddings. In contrast to applying independent Transformers to the language and visual inputs (as in ViLBERT  and LXMERT ), UNITER adopts a single Transformer applied to the textual and image inputs like . \nVisualBert , Uniter , VL-BERT , VilBERT , and Unicoder-VL  models for VLP concatenate image and text features and leave it to the self-attention to automatically discover cross-modal relationships. This can complicate the visual grounding of semantic concepts in an image. To address this problem, Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-Training (Oscar)  first uses an object detector to obtain object tags (labels), which are then subsequently used as a mechanism to align relevant visual features with the semantic information (Fig.~\\ref{fig:multi-modal-archs}-b). The motivation is that the textual content generally pertains to major objects in the image, therefore by explicitly adding those image labels to the input, visual features can be better attended. \nSimilar to BERT , Oscar uses a Masked Token Loss for VLP, where different tokens in the textual input and image tags are randomly masked and the model predicts these missing tokens. Further, it also uses a contrastive loss that discriminates between the original and noisy/fake image-tag pairs. The representations thus learned are fine-tuned on VQA, cross-modality retrieval, natural language reasoning, and image captioning tasks to obtain better performances compared to VLP methods that do not use object tags. \\sk{The recent VinVL  approach extends Oscar for the object detection task and learns object instance-centered relationships between visual and language domains using an adapted pretraining scheme. The model is trained on a collection of datasets (MS-COCO, OpenImages, Visual Genome and Objects365) and was demonstrated to precisely relate semantic attributes with the visual information and provided better transferability to the downstream visual comprehension tasks. }\n\\begin{figure}[]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Figs/Vokenizer.png}\n    \\caption{\\small Visualized tokens (Vokens) : A language model is visually supervised using closely related images that leads to better feature representations from the pretrained model.

Given a video,  converts speech to text using off-the-shelf speech recognition systems and applies vector quantization (clustering) to obtain visual features from pre-trained video classification models. The BERT model is then directly applied to these concatenated sequences of language and visual tokens to learn their joint distribution. \nThe model can be trained with only-text, video-only, and video+text domains.

Neimark \\emph{et al.}  propose Video Transformer Network (VTN) that first obtains frame-wise features using 2D CNN and apply a Transformer encoder (Longformer ) on top to learn temporal relationships. \nLongformer is an attractive choice to process long sequences (with an arbitrary length $n$) due to its $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity. \nThe classification token is passed through  a fully connected layer to recognize actions or events. The advantage of using Transformer encoder on top of spatial features is two fold: (a) it allows processing a complete video in a single pass, and (b) considerably improves training and inference efficiency by avoiding the expensive 3D convolutions. \nThis makes VTN particularly suitable for modeling long videos where interactions between entities are spread throughout the video length. Their experiments on Kinetics-400 dataset  with various backbones (ResNet , ViT  and DeiT ) shows competitive performance.\nGirdhar \\etal  use a variant of Transformer architecture to aggregate person-specific contextual cues in a video for action classification and localization. Initially, the model uses a Faster-RCNN  style processing where a backbone model generates features that are forwarded to the Region Proposal Network to obtain object proposals. Then RoI pooling is applied to generate object-specific features. Multi-head self-attention  is then applied on top of the object features as a cascade of self-attention layers. In each Transformer unit, a particular person feature is treated as the `query' (Q), while the features from the neighboring video clip are used as `key' (K) and `value' (V). The location information is explicitly encoded in the input feature map from which K, V and Q are derived, thus incorporating the positional information in the self-attention. For a given $400$$\\times$$400$$\\times$$64$ video clip, the key and value tensors are of size $16$$\\times$$25$$\\times$$25$$\\times$$128$, while the query is $128$ dimensional vector.  Although  uses only RGB stream, additional modalities like optical flow and audio signal (as in competing works) would further increase the compute complexity. Further, the Transformer model was found to be sub-optimal for action localization, perhaps due to its tendency to incorporate global information. Therefore, it is important to achieve the right trade-off between the global and local context for problems that demand precise delineation (\\eg, action localization and segmentation).\nHuman action recognition based on skeleton representation requires understanding relationships between different joints of a body in a given frame as well as between different frames of a video. Plizzari \\etal  proposed a two-stream Transformer network to model such relationships. They introduced spatial self-attention (SSA) to model relations between different body-joints (Fig.~\\ref{fig:ssa})\n while temporal self-attention (TSA) to capture long-range inter-frame dependencies (Fig.~\\ref{fig:tsa}).\n They first used a small residual network to extract features from skeleton data and then used SSA and TSA modules to process those feature maps. SSA finds the correlation between each pair of joints independently, while TSA focuses on how features of a certain joint change between frames along the temporal dimension. The purpose of SSA is to discover relationships among the surrounding joints in the same way as the Transformer relates different words in a phrase. On the other hand, TSA finds long-range relations between frames, similar to how relations among phrases are built in NLP. The two streamed model achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU-RGB+D 60  and NTU-RGB+D 120  datasets.\n \\mh{\nMultiscale Vision Transformers (MViT)  build a feature hierarchy by progressively expanding the channel capacity and reducing the spatio-temporal resolution in videos. They introduce multi-head pooling attention to gradually change the visual resolution in their pyramid structure. TimeSFormer  extends ViTs  to videos, by considering the video as a sequence of patches extracted from individual frames. To capture spatio-temporal relationships, they propose divided attention i.e., spatial and temporal attentions are separately applied within each block. TimeSFormer demonstrates SoTA performance on action recognition, and can be applied to clips over one minute.  Another notable pure-transformer based model is the Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) . First, the spatio-temporal tokens are extracted and then efficient factorised versions of self-attention are applied to encode relationships between tokens. However, they require initialization with image-pretrained models to effectively learn the ViT models. There has also been concurrent work on learning sound pretrained models using self-supervised learning with ViTs. An important recent effort is the long-short contrastive learning (LSTCL) framework , which reconstructs representations from different time-scales (narrow and broad) as auxiliary learning tasks and demonstrates good down-stream performance. \n}", "cites": [8001, 5795, 1283, 7298, 5794, 4830, 97, 5797, 2907, 7590, 209, 732, 4776, 1470, 5796, 38], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 16, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple papers into a coherent narrative on how Transformers are being applied to video action recognition, including spatial and temporal modeling.

However, the patch-wise attention computation is computationally expensive. We elaborate on these approaches below.\nDoersch \\etal  explore the utility of self-supervision and Transformer model for few-shot fine-grained classification, where distribution mismatch exists between training and evaluation phases. \nThey develop Cross-Transformer model to relate a given query image with the few-examples available in the support set. To this end, the Transformer finds spatially similar regions in the query and support set images, and the corresponding features are then used to obtain class decisions for the query. The queries in the Transformer architecture are derived from the grid features obtained using the query image. Similarly, grid features from the support images are used to construct keys and values which are in turn used to derive attended outputs. This approach, besides a contrastive self-supervision based training mechanism, leads to the best performance on the challenging Meta-dataset .\nYe \\etal  propose to adapt the few-shot embeddings learned on the base classes to the few-shot target classes during inference using a Transformer module. This leads to task-specific embeddings that perform better on the discriminative tasks such as few-shot classification. While many other set-to-set functions are also evaluated, such as Graph convolutional networks , Bidirectional LSTMs  and DeepSets , the best performance is achieved with the Transformer-based mapping.

To this end, recent works  are motivated by the capability of Transformers to learn set-functions. Specifically,  introduced a Point Transformer which uses vector attention to learn weights for each channel, while  suggest an alternate design where local 3D structure is explicitly encoded. The non-local nature of Transformers is exploited in  towards an accurate human pose and mesh reconstruction algorithm. We discuss these approaches below.\nSelf-attention being a set-operator is ideally suited for processing point clouds, a 3D data representation that demands invariance to number of points and their permutations. Zhao \\etal~ propose a point Transformer layer that applies self-attention in the local neighborhood of 3D points. \n The proposed layer builds on vectorized self-attention network (SAN)  where attention weights are represented with vectors.\n Furthermore, a positional encoding \n is added both to the attention vector and transformed features (value vectors) to represent location information. The point Transformer layer is sandwiched between two linear layers to create a point Transformer block that is stacked multiple times in the developed network architecture. Their design also included transition down/up blocks to reduce/increase the number of points in the input (in a typical encoding-decoding pipeline style). The resulting architecture shows promising results on the 3D classification and segmentation tasks. \n \\begin{figure*}[htp]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{Figs/METRO.png}\n    \\caption{\\small Mesh Transformer architecture.

However, compared to , it is more directly based on the conventional Transformer architecture  and does not involve vector attention. The key modifications include a 3D coordinate-based position encoding, an offset attention module, and a neighbor embedding that encodes local 3D structure in point-clouds. Specifically, the offset attention layer calculates the difference between the self-attended features and the input features using element-wise subtraction. The local neighbor embedding simply finds self-attention relationships among a group of points instead of individual 3D points. Explicitly incorporating local neighbourhood information makes this a more efficient architecture compared to . The method shows promising performance on 3D shape classification, normal estimation and segmentation tasks on ModelNet40  and ShapeNet  datasets. \nThe Mesh Transformer (METRO)  model targets 3D human pose and mesh reconstruction from a single 2D image. A key challenge here is to faithfully learn the non-local interactions between body-joints and mesh vertices (\\eg, hand and foot). The expressivity of Transformer network is used to jointly model  \\emph{vertex to vertex} relationships in a mesh as well as the \\emph{vertex to body-joint} relationships. The self-attention mechanism can attend to any combination of vertices in the mesh, thereby encoding non-local relationships. \nThe multi-layer Transformer architecture sequentially performs dimensionality reduction to map the 2D image to 3D mesh. Position encoding is performed using the 3D coordinates ($x$,$y$,$z$) of each vertex and each body-joint. Similar to masked language modeling in NLP, METRO uses masked vertex modeling (MVM) which randomly masks some percentage of input queries (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:metro}). The Transformer is tasked with regressing all the joints and vertices which helps encode inter-dependencies between them.\nMETRO obtains state-of-the-art results on human mesh reconstruction on Human3.6M  and 3DPW  datasets.

For example,  explore selective or sparse attention to previous layer tokens while updating each next layer token.  Linformer  reduces complexity of standard self-attention  operation from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to  $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ (both in time and memory requirements). The main idea is to show that a low-rank matrix is sufficient to model the self-attention mechanism. The Reformer model \n employed locally-sensitive hashing (LSH) to minimize the complexity of self-attention from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to  $\\mathcal{O}(n\nlog(n))$. \\sk{In similar pursuit, the recent Lambda Networks propose to model local context as a linear function which helps reduce complexity of self-attention . These linear function lambdas are applied to the input query to model contextual relationships between pixels.}\nVyas \\etal  developed an efficient \\emph{cluster attention} to deal with large input sequences that approximates the original self-attention. The cluster attention groups queries into clusters and then computes attention between cluster centers (instead of attention between all the queries that leads to quadratic complexity). The main idea is that the queries close in the Euclidean space should have similar attention distributions. With a fixed number of clusters, this intuition helps reduce the quadratic complexity to linear complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(nc)$ with respect to the input sequence length $n$ (where $c$ is the number of clusters). We refer interested readers to a survey on efficient Transformers in NLP .\nSimilar to the NLP domain, computer vision models also suffer from the high computational cost of Transformer models. For example, image generators that are based on sequence-based Transformers (\\eg, iGPT) have a high compute cost limiting their applicability to high-resolution inputs. {The time and memory cost of core self-attention operation in Transformers increases quadratically with the number of patches, i.e. $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, for $n$ image patches (in some applications, e.g., low-level vision, $n=H\n\\times W$ where $H,W$ denote the height and width of the image). This is a major drawback of existing Transformers that hinders their application to most tasks involving high-resolution (HR) images, such as object detection and segmentation (in high-level vision), and super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, etc. (in low-level vision). Numerous methods have been proposed that make special design choices to perform self-attention more `efficiently', for instance employing pooling/downsampling in self-attention~, local window-based attention~, axial-attention~, low-rank projection attention~, kernelizable attention~, and similarity-clustering based methods~. However, almost all of these approaches either come with a trade-off between complexity and accuracy, require special hardware specifications or are still not applicable to very large images. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an efficient self-attention mechanism that can be applied to HR images on resource-limited systems without compromising accuracy. It will be interesting to explore how existing models can be extended to high-dimensional cases \\eg, using a \\emph{multi-scale transformer} design with a somewhat local context modeling.} By inducing inductive biases based on our understanding of the visual learning tasks (e.g., spatial relationships in the local neighbourhood), the high computational cost can be reduced. Similarly, using sparse attention maps modeled with low-rank factorization in the matrices can also help towards reducing the computational cost .", "cites": [7367, 679, 1484, 7167, 4778, 2519, 7590, 7993, 8950, 8434, 8384, 7796, 4784, 2017, 4780, 4795, 7360, 5803, 7302, 5794, 5764, 7997, 5804, 1182, 4823, 1278, 4793, 38, 7333, 5762, 7366, 5774, 502, 7298, 97, 793, 7, 7373, 732, 4782, 5796, 4769, 1501, 7385, 1472, 1639, 5802, 5240, 1473, 4766, 5337, 4776, 794, 7848, 2577, 4779], "cite_extract_rate": 0.875, "origin_cites_number": 64, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key design choices and scalability challenges across multiple vision Transformer variants, highlighting computational trade-offs.

For example, a CNN has inbuilt translation invariance, weight sharing, and partial scale invariance due to pooling operations or multi-scale processing blocks. However, a Transformer network needs to figure out these image-specific concepts on its own from the training examples. Similarly, relationships between video frames need to be discovered automatically by the self-attention mechanism by looking at a large database of video sequences. This results in longer training times, a significant increase in computational requirements, and large datasets for processing. For example, the ViT  model requires hundreds of millions of image examples to obtain reasonable performance on the ImageNet benchmark dataset. The question of learning a Transformer in a data-efficient manner is an open research problem and recent works report encouraging steps towards its resolution. For example, DeiT  uses a distillation approach to achieve data efficiency while T2T (Tokens-to-Token) ViT  models local structure by combining spatially close tokens together, thus leading to competitive performance when trained only on ImageNet from scratch (without pre-training). \\mh{By incorporating CNNs like feature hierarchies in ViTs to effectively capture  local image cues, ViTs (e.g., CCT , NesT ) can be trained from scratch even on small-scale datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10).\nAnother approach to data efficient training of ViTs is proposed in \\etal .

This is an open problem, however, some recent works  target enhanced interpretability of Transformers and report encouraging results. Attention roll-out and attention flow methods were proposed in  to estimate the accurate attentions. However, this method functions in an ad-hoc manner and makes simplistic assumptions \\eg, input tokens are linearly combined using attention weights across the layers. Chefer \\etal~ note that the attention scores obtained directly via the self-attention process (encoding relationships between tokens) or reassignments in  do not provide an optimal solution. As an alternative, they propose to assign and propagate \\emph{relevancy scores} in the Transformer network such that the sum of relevancy is constant throughout the network. Their design can handle both the positive and negative attributions experienced in the self-attention layer. The proposed framework has an added advantage of being able to provide class-specific visualizations. Despite these seminal works, visualizing and interpreting Transformers is an unsolved problem and methods are needed to obtain spatially precise activation-specific visualizations.

In order to scale to high-dimensional inputs, Perceiver uses an asymmetric cross attention method to distill input information into low-dimensional latent bottleneck features. Once the features are distilled in a compact and fixed-dimensional form, regular Transformer blocks are applied in the latent space.  The original Perceiver model shows performance competitive to ResNets and ViTs on image classification and can process 3D data, audio, images, video or their combinations. However, this model can only generate fixed outputs e.g., class probabilities. A recent improvement called Perceiver IO  aims to learn models with both flexible inputs as well as arbitrary sized outputs. This allows application to problems which demand structured outputs such as natural language tasks and visual comprehension. While these models avoid modality dependent architectural choices, the learning itself still involves modality dependent choices e.g., specific augmentations or positional encodings.
