Therefore, it is important to remediate critical SVs as promptly as possible.\nVulnerability assessment is required to prioritize the remediation of critical SVs among a large and increasing number of SVs each year~ (e.g., more than 20,000 SVs were reported on National Vulnerability Database (NVD)~ in 2021). SV assessment includes tasks that determine various characteristics such as the types, exploitability, impact and severity levels of SVs~. Such characteristics help understand and select high-priority SVs to resolve early given the limited effort and resources. For example, an identified cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection vulnerability in a web application will likely require an urgent remediation plan. These two types of SVs are well-known and can be easily exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access and compromise sensitive data/information. On the other hand, an SV that requires admin access or happens only in a local network will probably have a lower priority since only a few people can initiate an attack.\nThere has been an active research area to assess and prioritize SVs using increasingly large data from multiple sources.\nMany studies in this area have proposed different Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to leverage such data to automate various tasks such as predicting the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)~ metrics (e.g.,~) or public exploits (e.g.,~).\nThese prediction models can learn the patterns automatically from vast SV data, which would be otherwise impossible to do manually. Such patterns are utilized to speed up the assessment and prioritization processes of ever-increasing and more complex SVs, significantly reducing practitioners' effort.\nDespite the rising research interest in data-driven SV assessment and prioritization, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art methods and existing challenges in this area.\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\fontsize{8}{9}\\selectfont\n\\caption{Comparison of contributions between our survey and the existing related surveys/reviews.}\n\\label{tab:survey_comparison}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|P{3cm}|P{3cm}|P{3cm}|}\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\\diagbox[height=1.3cm, width=3.6cm]{\\raisebox{2\\height}{\\enspace \\textbf{Study}}}{\\raisebox{-1\\height}{\\enspace \\textbf{Contribution}}}} &\n\\multicolumn{1}{P{2.9cm}|}{\\centering\\textbf{Focus on SV assessment \\& prioritization}} & \\multicolumn{1}{P{2.9cm}|}{\\centering\\textbf{Analysis of SV\\\\data sources}} & \\multicolumn{1}{P{2.9cm}|}{\\centering\\textbf{Analysis of data-\\\\driven approaches (NLP/ML/DL)}}\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\makecell[l]{Ghaffarian et al. 2017~} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\makecell[c]{\\checkmark (Mostly ML)} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\makecell[l]{Lin et al. 2020~\\\\ Semasaba et al. 2020~\\\\ Singh et al. 2020~\\\\ Zeng et al. 2020~} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\makecell[c]{\\checkmark (Mostly DL)} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{1}{|p{2.8cm}|}{Pastor et al. 2020~} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\makecell[c]{\\checkmark (OSINT)} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\makecell[l]{Sun et al. 2018~\\\\ Evangelista et al. 2020~} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\makecell[c]{\\checkmark (OSINT)} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\checkmark} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\makecell[l]{Khan et al. 2018~} & \\makecell[c]{\\checkmark (Rule-based methods)} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{1}{|p{2.8cm}|}{Kritikos et al. 2019~} & \\makecell[c]{\\checkmark (Static analysis)} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\checkmark} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{1}{|p{3.2cm}|}{Dissanayake et al. 2020~} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\checkmark (Socio-technical aspects)} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{--} \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n\\rowcolor{lightgray}\n\\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\\textbf{Our survey}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textbf{\\checkmark}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textbf{\\checkmark}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textbf{\\checkmark}} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\\noindent \\textbf{Our Contributions}. \\circled{1} We are the first to review in-depth the research studies that automate \\textit{data-driven SV assessment and prioritization} tasks leveraging SV data and NLP/ML/DL techniques.\n\\circled{2} We categorize and describe the key tasks performed in relevant primary studies.\n\\circled{3} We synthesize and discuss the pros and cons of data, features, models, evaluation methods and metrics commonly used in the reviewed studies.\n\\circled{4} We highlight the challenges with the current practices and propose potential solutions moving forward.\nOur findings can provide useful guidelines for researchers and practitioners to effectively utilize data to perform SV assessment and prioritization.\nAn online and up-to-date (by accepting external contributions) version of the survey can be found at \\textcolor{blue}{\\url{https://github.com/lhmtriet/awesome-vulnerability-assessment}}.\n\\noindent \\textbf{Related Work}.\nThere have been several existing surveys/reviews on SV analysis and prediction, but they are fundamentally different from ours (see Table~\\ref{tab:survey_comparison}).\nGhaffarian et al.~ conducted a seminal survey on ML-based SV analysis and discovery.\nSubsequently, several studies~ reviewed DL techniques for detecting vulnerable code.\nHowever, these prior reviews did not describe how ML/DL techniques can be used to assess and prioritize the detected SVs.\nThere have been other relevant reviews on using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) (e.g., phishing or malicious emails/URLs/IPs) to make informed security decisions~. However, these OSINT reviews did not explicitly discuss the use of SV data and how such data can be leveraged to automate the assessment and prioritization processes. Moreover, most of the reviews on SV assessment and prioritization have focused on either static analysis tools~ or rule-based approaches (e.g., expert systems or ontologies)~.\nThese methods rely on pre-defined patterns and struggle to work with new types and different data sources of SVs compared to contemporary ML or DL approaches presented in our survey~.\nRecently, Dissanayake et al.~ reviewed the socio-technical challenges and solutions for security patch management that involves SV assessment and prioritization after SV patches are identified.\nUnlike~, we focus on the challenges, solutions and practices of automating various SV assessment and prioritization tasks with data-driven techniques.\nWe also consider all types of SV assessment/prioritization regardless of the patch availability.\n\\noindent \\textbf{Paper Outline}.

Specifically, we extracted the themes by grouping related SV assessment or prioritization tasks that the surveyed studies aim to automate/predict using data-driven models. Note that a paper is categorized into more than one theme if that paper develops models for multiple cross-theme tasks.\nWe acknowledge that there can be other ways to categorize the studies. However, we assert the reliability of our taxonomy as all of our themes (except theme 5) align with the security standards used in practice. For example, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)~ provides a framework to characterize exploitability, impact and severity of SVs (themes 1-3), while Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)~ includes many vulnerability types (theme 4). Hence, we believe our taxonomy can help identify and bridge the knowledge gap between the academic literature and industrial practices, making it relevant and potentially beneficial for both researchers and practitioners. Details of each theme in our taxonomy are covered in subsequent sections.\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{8}{9}\\selectfont\n\\centering\n\\caption{List of the surveyed papers in the \\textit{Exploit Likelihood} sub-theme of the \\textit{Exploitation} theme.\n\\textbf{Note}: The nature of task of this sub-theme is binary classification of existence/possibility of proof-of-concept and/or real-world exploits.\n}\n\\label{tab:exploit_studies_likelihood}\n\\begin{tabular}[!t]{|p{1.5cm}|p{6.2cm}|p{5cm}|}\n  \\hline \\textbf{Study} & \\textbf{Data source} & \\textbf{Data-driven technique}\\\\\\hline\n  Bozorgi et al. 2010~ & CVE, Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) & Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)\\\\\\hline\n  Sabottke et al. 2015~ & NVD, Twitter, OSVDB, ExploitDB, Symantec security advisories, private Microsoft security advisories & Linear SVM\\\\\\hline\n  Edkrantz et al. 2015~ & NVD, Recorded Future security advisories, ExploitDB & Na\\\"ive Bayes, Linear SVM, Random forest\\\\\\hline\n  Bullough et al. 2017~ & NVD, Twitter, ExploitDB & Linear SVM\\\\\\hline\n  Almukaynizi et al.~ & NVD, ExploitDB, Zero Day Initiative security advisories \\& Darkweb forums/markets & SVM, Random forest, Na\\\"ive Bayes, Bayesian network, Decision tree, Logistic regression\\\\\\hline\n  Xiao et al. 2018~ & NVD, SecurityFocus security advisories, Symantec \\newline Spam/malicious activities based on daily blacklists from abuseat.org, spamhaus.org, spamcop.net, uceprotect.net, wpbl.info \\& list of unpatched SVs in hosts & Identification of malicious activity groups with community detection algorithms + Random forest for exploit prediction\\\\\\hline\n  Tavabi et al. 2018~ & NVD, 200 sites on Darkweb, ExploitDB, Symantec, Metasploit & Paragraph embedding + Radial basis function kernel SVM\\\\\\hline\n  de Sousa et al. 2020~ & NVD, Twitter, ExploitDB, Symantec\\newline Avast, ESET, Trend Micro security advisories & Linear SVM, Logistic regression, XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)\\\\\\hline\n  Fang et al. 2020~ & NVD, ExploitDB, SecurityFocus, Symantec & fastText + LGBM\\\\\\hline\n  Huang et al. 2020~ & NVD, CVE Details, Twitter, ExploitDB, Symantec security advisories & Random forest\\\\\\hline\n  Jacobs et al. 2020~ & NVD, Kenna Security \\newline Exploit sources: Exploit DB, Metasploit, FortiGuard Labs, SANS Internet Storm Center, Securewords CTU, Alienvault OSSIM, Canvas/D2 Security's Elliot Exploitation Frameworks, Contagio, Reversing Labs\n  & XGBoost\\\\\\hline\n  Yin et al. 2020~ & NVD, ExploitDB, General text: Book Corpus \\& Wikipedia for pretraining BERT models & Fine-tuning BERT models pretrained on general text\\\\\\hline\n  Bhatt et al. 2021~ & NVD, ExploitDB & Features augmented by SV types + Decision tree, Random forest, Na\\\"ive Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM\\\\\\hline\n  Suciu et al. 2021~ & NVD, Vulners database, Twitter, Symantec, SecurityFocus, IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence \\newline Exploit sources: ExploitDB, Metasploit, Canvas, D2 Security's Elliot, Tenable, Skybox, AlienVault, Contagio & Multi-layer perceptron\\\\\\hline\\hline\n  Younis et al. 2014~ & Vulnerable functions from NVD (Apache HTTP Server project), ExploitDB, OSVDB & SVM\\\\\\hline\n  Yan et al. 2017~ & Executables (binary code) of 100 Linux applications & Combining ML (Decision tree) output \\& fuzzing with a Bayesian network\\\\\\hline\n  Tripathi et al. 2017~ & Program crashes from VDiscovery~ \\& LAVA~ datasets & Static/Dynamic analysis features + Linear/Radial basis function kernel SVM\\\\\\hline\n  Zhang et al. 2018~ & Program crashes from VDiscovery~ dataset & $n$-grams of system calls from execution traces + Online passive-aggressive classifier\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}", "cites": [4881, 4879], "cite_extract_rate": 0.08, "origin_cites_number": 25, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of the taxonomy and includes a detailed table of studies under the 'Exploit Likelihood' sub-theme.

In 2010, Bozorgi et al.~ were the first to use SV descriptions on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)~ and Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB)\\footnote{\\url{http://osvdb.org}. Note that this database has been discontinued since 2016.} to predict exploit existence based on the labels on OSVDB. In 2015, Sabottke et al.~ conducted a seminal study that used Linear SVM and SV information on Twitter to predict PoC exploits on ExploitDB~ as well as real-world exploits on OSVDB, Symantec's attack signatures~ and private Microsoft's security advisories~. These authors urged to explicitly consider real-world exploits as \\textit{not} all PoC exploits would result in exploitation in practice.\nThey also showed SV-related information on Twitter\\footnote{\\url{https://twitter.com}} can enable earlier detection of exploits than using expert-verified SV sources (e.g., NVD).\nBuilt upon these two foundational studies~, the literature has mainly aimed to improve the performance and applicability of exploit prediction models by leveraging more exploit sources and/or better data-driven techniques/practices.\nMany researchers~ increased the amount of ground-truth exploits using extensive sources other than ExploitDB and Symantec in~. The sources were security advisories such as Zero Day Initiative~, Metasploit~, SecurityFocus~, Recorded Future~, Kenna Security~, Avast\\footnote{\\url{https://avast.com/exploit-protection.php}. This link was provided by de Sousa et al.~, but it is no longer available.}, ESET~, Trend Micro~, malicious activities in hosts based on traffic of spam/malicious IP addresses~ and Darkweb sites/forums/markets~. In addition to enriching exploit sources, better data-driven models and practices for exploit prediction were also studied. Ensemble models (e.g., Random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)~, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)~) were shown to outperform single-model baselines (e.g., Na\\\"ive Bayes, SVM, Logistic regression and Decision tree) for exploit prediction~.\nAdditionally, Bullough et al.~ identified and addressed several issues with exploit prediction models, e.g., time sensitivity of SV data, already-exploited SVs before disclosure and training data imbalance, helping to improve the practical application of such models. Recently, Yin et al.~ demonstrated that transfer learning is an alternative solution for improving the performance of exploit prediction with scarcely labeled exploits. Specifically, these authors pre-trained a DL model, BERT~, on massive non-SV sources (e.g., text on Book Corpus~ and Wikipedia~) and then fine-tuned this pre-trained model on SV data using additional pooling and dense layers. Bhatt et al.~ also suggested that incorporating the types of SVs (e.g., SQL injection) into ML models can further enhance the predictive effectiveness. Suciu et al.~ empirically showed that unifying SV-related sources used in prior work (e.g., SV databases~, social media~, SV-related discussions~ and PoC code in ExploitDB~) supports more effective and timely prediction of \\textit{functional} exploits~.\nBesides using SV descriptions as input for exploit prediction, several studies in this sub-theme have also predicted exploits on the code level.\nYounis et al.~ predicted the exploitability of vulnerable functions in the Apache HTTP Server project. Specifically, these authors used an SVM model with features extracted from the dangerous system calls~ in entry points/functions~ and the reachability from any of these entry points to vulnerable functions~.\nMoving from high-level to binary code, Yan et al.~ first used a Decision tree to obtain prior beliefs about SV types in 100 Linux applications using static features (e.g., \\textit{hexdump}) extracted from executables. Subsequently, they applied various fuzzing tools (i.e., Basic Fuzzing Framework~ and OFuzz~) to detect SVs with the ML-predicted types. They finally updated the posterior beliefs about the exploitability based on the outputs of the ML model and fuzzers using a Bayesian network. The proposed method outperformed \\textit{!exploitable},\\footnote{\\url{https://microsoft.com/security/blog/2013/06/13/exploitable-crash-analyzer-version-1-6}} a static crash analyzer provided by Microsoft.\nTripathi et al.~ also predicted SV exploitability from crashes (i.e., VDiscovery~ and LAVA~ datasets) using an SVM model and static features from core dumps and dynamic features generated by the Last Branch Record hardware debugging utility.\nZhang et al.~ proposed two improvements to Tripathi et al.~'s approach. These authors first replaced the hardware utility in~ that may not be available for resource-constrained devices (e.g., IoT) with sequence/$n$-grams of system calls extracted from execution traces. They also used an online passive-aggressive classifier~ to enable online/incremental learning of exploitability for new crash batches on-the-fly.\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{8}{9}\\selectfont\n\\centering\n\\caption{List of the surveyed papers in the \\textit{Exploit Time} sub-theme of the \\textit{Exploitation} theme.}\n\\label{tab:exploit_studies_time}\n\\begin{tabular}[!t]{|p{1.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{3.5cm}|p{3cm}|}\n  \\hline \\textbf{Study} & \\textbf{Nature of task} & \\textbf{Data source} & \\textbf{Data-driven technique}\\\\\\hline\n  Bozorgi et al. 2010~ & \\textit{Binary classification}: Likelihood that SVs would be exploited within 2 to 30 days after disclosure & CVE, OSVDB & Linear SVM\\\\\\hline\n  Edkrantz 2015~ & \\multirowcell{2}[0ex][l]{\\textit{Binary classification}: Likelihood of\\\\SV exploits within 12 months after\\\\disclosure} & NVD, ExploitDB, Recorded Future security advisories & SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na\\\"ive Bayes, Random forest\\\\\\hhline{-~*{2}{-}}\n  Jacobs et al. 2019~ & & NVD, Kenna Security \\newline Exploit sources: Exploit DB, Metasploit, D2 Security's Elliot \\& Canvas Exploitation Frameworks, Fortinet, Proofpoint, AlienVault \\& GreyNoise & Logistic regression\\\\\\hline\n  Chen et al. 2019~ & \\textit{Binary classification}: Likelihood that SVs would be exploited within 1/3/6/9/12 months after disclosure \\newline \\textit{Regression}: number of days until SV exploits after disclosure & CVE, Twitter, ExploitDB, Symantec security advisories & Graph neural network embedding + Linear regression, Bayes, Random forest, XGBoost, Lasso/Ridge regression\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}", "cites": [4882, 4884, 7, 4881, 4883, 4879], "cite_extract_rate": 0.12, "origin_cites_number": 50, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple studies by tracing the evolution from foundational work (e.g., Bozorgi and Sabottke) to advanced methods using diverse exploit sources and improved ML techniques.

Besides prediction, Toloudis et al.~ used principal component analysis~ and Spearman's $\\rho$ correlation coefficient to reveal the predictive contribution of each word in SV descriptions to each CVSS metric. However, this technique does not directly produce the value of each metric.\nRecently, several studies have started to predict CVSS version 3 exploitability metrics including the new Privileges and User Interactions.\nOgnawala et al.~ fed the features generated by a static analysis tool, Macke~, to a Random forest model to predict these CVSS version 3 metrics for vulnerable software/components.\nLater, Chen et al.~ found that many SVs were disclosed on Twitter before on NVD. Therefore, these authors developed a system built on top of a Graph Convolutional Network~ capturing the content and relationships of related Twitter posts about SVs to enable more timely prediction of the CVSS version 3 metrics.\nElbaz et al.~ developed a linear regression model to predict the numerical output of each metric and then obtained the respective categorical value with the numerical value closest to the predicted value. For example, a predicted value of 0.8 for Attack Vector CVSS v3 is mapped to \\textit{Network} (0.85)~.\nTo prepare a clean dataset to predict these CVSS metrics, Jiang et al.~ replaced inconsistent CVSS values in various SV sources (i.e., NVD, ICS CERT and vendor websites) with the most frequent value.\nInstead of building a separate model for each CVSS metric, there has been another family of approaches predicting these metrics using a single model to increase efficiency. Gawron et al.~ and Spanos et al.~ predicted multiple CVSS metrics as a unique string instead of individual values. The output of each metric is then extracted from the concatenated string.\nLater, Gong et al.~ adopted the idea of a unified model from the DL perspective by using the multi-task learning paradigm~ to predict CVSS metrics simultaneously. The model has a feature extraction module (based on a Bi-LSTM model with attention mechanism~) shared among all the CVSS metrics/tasks, yet specific prediction head/layer for each metric/task. This model outperformed single-task counterparts while requiring much less time to (re-)train.\nAlthough CVSS exploitability metrics were most commonly used, several studies used other schemes for characterizing exploitation. Chen et al.~ used Linear SVM and SV descriptions to predict multiple SV characteristics, including three \\textit{SV locations} (i.e., Local, LAN and Remote) on SecurityFocus~ and Secunia~ databases as well as 11 \\textit{SV causes}\\footnote{Access/Input/Origin validation error, Atomicity/Configuration/Design/Environment/Serialization error, Boundary condition error, Failure on exceptions, Race condition error} on SecurityFocus.\nRegarding the exploit types, Rouhonen et al.~ used LDA~ and Random forest to classify whether an exploit would affect a web application. This study can help find relevant exploits in components/sub-systems of a large system.\nFor privileges, Aksu et al.~ extended the Privileges Required metric of CVSS by incorporating the context (i.e., Operating system or Application) to which privileges are applied (see Table~\\ref{tab:exploit_studies_prop}).\nThey found MLP~ to be the best-performing model for obtaining these privileges from SV descriptions. They also utilized the predicted privileges to generate attack graphs (sequence of attacks from source to sink nodes).\nLiu et al.~ advanced this task by combining information gain for feature selection and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)~ for feature extraction.\nRegarding attack patterns, Kanakogi et al.~ found Doc2vec~ to be more effective than term-frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf) when combined with cosine similarity to find the most relevant Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)~ for a given SV on NVD. Such attack patterns can manifest how identified SVs can be exploited by adversaries, assisting the selection of suitable countermeasures.", "cites": [168, 4887, 8850, 4878, 4886, 7265, 326], "cite_extract_rate": 0.21875, "origin_cites_number": 32, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple papers, tracing the evolution of approaches for predicting exploit characteristics (e.g., CVSS v2 to v3, handling concept drift).

Version 3 also has a new metric, \\textit{Scope}, that specifies whether an exploited SV would affect only the system that contains the SV. For example, \\textit{Scope} changes when an SV occurring in a virtual machine affects the whole host machine, in turn increasing individual impacts.\nThe studies that predicted the CVSS impact metrics are mostly the same as the ones predicting the CVSS exploitability metrics in section~\\ref{sec:exploit_prediction}.\nGiven the overlap, we hereby only describe the main directions and techniques of the \\textit{Impact}-related tasks rather than iterating the details of each study.\nOverall, a majority of the work has focused on classifying CVSS impact metrics (versions 2 and 3) using three main learning paradigms: single-task~, multi-target~ and multi-task~ learning. Instead of developing a separate prediction model for each metric like the single-task approach, multi-target and multi-task approaches only need a single model for all tasks. Multi-target learning predicts concatenated output; whereas, multi-task learning uses shared feature extraction for all tasks and task-specific softmax layers to determine the output of each task. These three learning paradigms were powered by applying and/or customizing a wide range of data-driven methods. The first method was to use single ML classifiers like supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation~, Principal component analysis~, Na\\\"ive Bayes~, Logistic regression~, Kernel-based SVM~, Linear SVM~, KNN~ and Decision tree~. Other studies employed ensemble models combining the strength of multiple single models such as Random forest~, boosting model~ and XGBoost/LGBM~.

This setting can be considered as multi-class classification. Spanos et al.~ were to first one to show the applicability of ML to classify SVs into one of the three severity levels using SV descriptions. These three levels are provided by NVD and based on the severity score of CVSS version 2~ and WIVSS~, i.e., Low (0.0 -- 3.9), Medium (4.0 -- 6.9), High (7.0 -- 10.0). Note that WIVSS assigns different weights for the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact metrics of CVSS, enhancing the ability to capture varied contributions of these impacts to the final severity score. Later, Wang et al.~ showed that XGBoost~ performed the best among the investigated ML classifiers for predicting these three NVD-based severity levels. Le et al.~ also confirmed that ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost~, LGBM~ and Random forest) outperformed single models (e.g., Na\\\"ive Bayes, KNN and SVM) for this task. Predicting severity levels has also been tackled with DL techniques~ such as Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN)~, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)~, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)~. These studies showed potential performance gain of DL models compared to traditional ML counterparts. Han et al.~ showed that DL techniques (i.e., 1-layer CNN) also achieved promising results for predicting a different severity categorization, namely Atlassian's levels.\\footnote{\\url{https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/security-severity-levels}} Such findings were successfully replicated by Sahin et al.~. Nakagawa et al.~ further enhanced the DL model performance for the same task by incorporating the character-level features into a CNN model~. Complementary to performance enhancement, Gong et al.~ proposed to predict these severity levels concurrently with other CVSS metrics in a single model using multi-task learning~ powered by an attention-based Bi-LSTM shared feature extraction model. The unified model was demonstrated to increase both the prediction effectiveness and efficiency.\nBesides Atlassian's categories, several studies applied ML models to predict severity levels on other platforms such as Secunia~ and China National Vulnerability Database\\footnote{\\url{https://www.cnvd.org.cn}}~. Instead of using textual categories, Khazaei et al.~ divided the CVSS severity score into 10 bins with 10 increments each (e.g., values of 0 -- 0.9 are in one bin) and obtained decent results (86-88\\% Accuracy) using Linear SVM, Random forest and Fuzzy system.", "cites": [4878, 4883, 326, 1096], "cite_extract_rate": 0.19047619047619047, "origin_cites_number": 21, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.3}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a factual summary of the surveyed papers by listing their tasks, data sources, and techniques.

Wang et al.~ were the first to tackle this problem with a Na\\\"ive Bayes model using the CVSS metrics (version 2)~ and product names. Later, Shuai et al.~ used LDA~ with a location-aware weighting to extract important features from SV descriptions for building an effective SVM-based CWE classifier. Na et al.~ also showed that features extracted from SV descriptions can improve the Na\\\"ive Bayes model in~.\nRuohonen et al.~ studied an information retrieval method, i.e., term-frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and cosine similarity, to detect the CWE-ID with a description most similar to that of a given SV collected from NVD and Snyk.\\footnote{\\url{https://snyk.io/vuln}} This method performed well for CWEs without clear patterns/keywords in SV descriptions.\nAota et al.~ utilized the Boruta feature selection algorithm~ and Random forest to improve the performance of \\textit{base} CWE classification.\nBase CWEs give more fine-grained information for SV remediation than categorical CWEs used in~.\nThere has been a recent rise in using neural network/DL based models for CWE classification. Huang et al.~ implemented a deep neural network with tf-idf and information gain for the task and obtained better performance than SVM, Na\\\"ive Bayes and KNN. Aghaei et al.~ improved upon~ for both categorical (coarse-grained) and base (fine-grained) CWE classification with an adaptive hierarchical neural network to determine sequences of less to more fine-grained CWEs. To capture the hierarchical structure and rare classes of CWEs, Das et al.~ matched SV and CWE descriptions instead of predicting CWEs directly.\nThey presented a deep Siamese network with a BERT-based~ shared feature extractor that outperformed many baselines even for rare/unseen CWE classes. Recently, Zou et al.~ pioneered the multi-class classification of CWE in vulnerable functions curated from Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD)~ and NVD. They achieved high performance ($\\sim$95\\% F1-score) with DL (Bi-LSTM) models. The strength of their model came from combining global (semantically related statements) and local (variables/statements affecting function calls) features. Note that this model currently only works for functions in C/C++ and 40 selected classes of CWE.\nAnother group of studies has considered unsupervised learning methods to extract CWE sequences, patterns and relationships.\nSequences of SV types over time were identified by Murtaza et al.~ using an $n$-gram model.\nThis model sheds light on both co-occurring and upcoming CWEs (grams), raising awareness of potential cascading attacks. Lin et al.~ applied an association rule mining algorithm, FP-growth~, to extract the rules/patterns of various CWEs aspects including types, programming language, time of introduction and consequence scope. For example, buffer overflow (CWE type) usually appears during the implementation phase (time of introduction) in C/C++ (programming language) and affects the availability (consequence scope). Lately, Han et al.~ developed a deep knowledge graph embedding technique to mine the relationships among CWE types, assisting in finding relevant SV types with similar properties.", "cites": [4889, 7, 7860], "cite_extract_rate": 0.15789473684210525, "origin_cites_number": 19, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes information from multiple papers to present a coherent narrative around different approaches to CWE classification, including traditional ML, DL, and unsupervised learning.

This was one of the earliest studies that automated SV type classification.\nTopic modeling is another popular unsupervised learning model~ to categorize SVs without an existing taxonomy. Neuhaus et al.~ applied LDA~ on SV descriptions to identify 28 prevalent SV types and then analyzed the trends of such types over time. The identified SV topics/types had considerable overlaps (up to 98\\% precision and 95\\% recall) with CWEs. Mounika et al.~ extended~ to map the LDA topics with the top-10 OWASP~. However, the LDA topics/keywords did not agree well ($<$ 40\\%) with the OWASP descriptions, probably because 10 topics did not cover all the underlying patterns of SV descriptions.\nAljedaani et al.~ again used LDA to identify 10 types of SVs reported in the bug tracking system of Chromium\\footnote{\\url{https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list}} and found memory-related issues were the most prevalent topics.\nAnother group of studies has classified manually defined/selected SV types rather than CWE as some SV types are encountered more often in practice and require more attention. Williams et al.~ applied a supervised topical evolution model~ to identify the features that best described the 10 pre-defined SV types\\footnote{1. Buffer errors, 2. Cross-site scripting, 3.

To support user-friendly SV assessment using ever-increasing unstructured SV data, Russo et al.~ used Bayesian network to predict 10 pre-defined SV types.\\footnote{1.

Unspecified vulnerability}\nBesides predicting manually defined SV types using SV natural language descriptions, Yan et al.~ used a decision tree to predict 22 SV types prevalent in the executables of Linux applications. The predicted type was then combined with fuzzers' outputs to predict SV exploitability (see section~\\ref{subsubsec:exploit_likelihood}).\nBesides author-defined types, custom SV types also come from specific SV platforms.\nZhang et al.~ designed an ML-based framework to predict the SV types collected from China National Vulnerability Database.

One of the earliest works was conducted by Weerawardhana et al.~. This study extracted software names/versions, impacts and attacker's/user's action from SV descriptions on NVD using Stanford Named Entity Recognition (NER) technique, a.k.a. CRF classifier~. Later, Dong et al.~ proposed to use a word/character-level Bi-LSTM to improve the performance of extracting vulnerable software names and versions from SV descriptions available on NVD and other SV databases/advisories (e.g., CVE Details~, ExploitDB~, SecurityFocus~, SecurityTracker~ and Openwall~). Based on the extracted entities, these authors also highlighted the inconsistencies in vulnerable software names and versions across different SV sources. Besides version products/names of SVs, Gonzalez et al.~ used a majority vote of different ML models (e.g., SVM and Random forest) to extract the 19 entities of Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO)~ from SV descriptions to check the consistency of these descriptions based on the guidelines of VDO.\nSince 2020, there has been a trend in using DL models (e.g., Bi-LSTM, CNNs or BERT~/ELMo~) to extract different information from SV descriptions including required elements for generating MulVal~ attack rules~ or SV types/root cause, attack type/vector~, Common Product Enumeration (CPE)~ for standardizing names of vulnerable vendors/products/versions~, part-of-speech~ and relevant entities (e.g., vulnerable products, attack type, root cause) from ExploitDB to generate SV descriptions~.

Linking multiple sources and their patterns is the first step towards building an SV knowledge graph to answer different queries regarding a particular SV (e.g., what systems are affected, exploitation status, how to fix, or what SVs are similar).

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:data_driven_elements}, a wide variety of data sources have been considered to accomplish the five identified themes.\nAcross the five themes, NVD~ and CVE~ have been the most prevalently used data sources.\nThe popularity of NVD/CVE is mainly because they publish expert-verified SV information that can be used to develop prediction models.\nFirstly, many studies have considered SV descriptions on NVD/CVE as model inputs. Secondly, the SV characteristics on NVD have been heavily used as assessment outputs in all the themes, e.g., CVSS Exploitability metrics for \\textit{Exploitation}, CVSS Impact/Scope metrics for \\textit{Impact}, CVSS severity score/levels for \\textit{Severity}, CWE for \\textit{Type}, CWE/CPE for \\textit{Miscellaneous tasks}. Thirdly, external sources on NVD/CVE have enabled many studies to obtain richer SV information (e.g., exploitation availability/time~ or vulnerable code/crashes~) and extract relationships among multiple SV sources to develop a knowledge graph of SVs (e.g.,~).\nHowever, NVD/CVE still suffer from information inconsistencies~ and missing relevant external sources (e.g., SV fixing code)~.\nSuch issues motivate future work to validate/clean NVD data and utilize more sources for code-based SV assessment and prioritization (see section~\\ref{subsubsec:developer_sources}).\nTo enrich the SV information on NVD/CVE, many other security advisories and SV databases have been commonly leveraged by the reviewed studies, notably ExploitDB~, Symantec~, SecurityFocus~, CVE Details~ and OSVDB. Most of these sources disclose PoC (ExploitDB and OSVDB) and/or real-world (Symantec and Security Focus) exploits. However, real-world exploits are much rarer and different compared to PoC ones~.\nIt is recommended that future work should explore more data sources (other than the ones in Table~\\ref{tab:exploit_studies_likelihood}) and better methods to retrieve real-world exploits (see section~\\ref{subsec:data_avail}).\nAdditionally, CVE Details and OSVDB are SV databases like NVD yet with a few key differences. CVE Details explicitly monitors Exploit-DB entries that may be missed on NVD and provides a more user-friendly interface to view/search SVs. OSVDB also reports SVs that do not appear on NVD (without CVE-ID), but this site was discontinued in 2016.\nBesides official/expert-verified data sources, we have seen an increasing interest in mining SV information from informal sources that also contain non-expert generated content such as social media (e.g., Twitter) and darkweb. Especially, Twitter has been widely used for predicting exploits as this platform has been shown to contain many SV disclosures even before official databases like NVD~. Recently, darkweb forums/sites/markets have also gained traction as SV mentions on these sites have a strong correlation with their exploits in the wild~. However, SV-related data on these informal sources are much noisier because they neither follow any pre-defined structure nor have any verification and they are even prone to fake news~. Thus, the data integrity of these sources should be checked,\npotentially by checking the reputation of posters, to avoid inputting unreliable data to prediction models and potentially producing misleading findings.", "cites": [4888, 4893], "cite_extract_rate": 0.1, "origin_cites_number": 20, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from cited papers and other sources to present a coherent narrative on the use and limitations of various SV data sources.

Its popularity is probably because it is one of the simplest ways to extract features from natural language descriptions of SVs and directly compatible with popular ML models (e.g., Linear SVM, Logistic regression and Random forest) in section~\\ref{subsec:prediction_model}. Besides plain term count/frequency, other studies have also considered different weighting mechanisms such as inverse document frequency weighting (tf-idf) or tf-igm~ inverse gravity moment weighting (tf-igm). Tf-igm has been shown to work better than BoW and tf-idf at classifying severity~.\nFuture work is still needed to evaluate the applicability and generalizability of tf-igm for other SV assessment and prioritization tasks.\nRecently, Neural Network (NN) or DL based features such as word2vec~ and BERT~ have been increasingly used to improve the performance of predicting CVSS exploitation/impact/severity metrics~, CWE types~ and SV information retrieval~. Compared to BoW and its variants, NN and DL can extract more efficient and context-aware features from vast SV data~. NN/DL techniques rely on distributed representation to encode SV-related words using fixed-length vectors much smaller than a vocabulary size. Moreover, these techniques capture the sequential order and context (nearby words) to enable better SV-related text comprehension (e.g., SV vs. general \\textit{exploit}). Importantly, these NN/DL learned features can be first trained in a non-SV domain with abundant data (e.g., Wikipedia pages~) and then transferred/fine-tuned in the SV domain to address limited/imbalanced SV data~. The main concern with these sophisticated NN/DL features is their limited interpretability, which is an exciting research area (see section~\\mbox{\\ref{subsubsec:interpretability}}).\nThe metadata about SVs can also complement the missing information in descriptions or code for SV assessment and prioritization. For example, prediction of exploits and their characteristics have been enhanced using CVSS metrics~, CPE~ and SV types~ on NVD. Additionally, Twitter-related statistics (e.g., number of followers, likes and retweets) have been shown to increase the performance of predicting SV exploitation, impact and severity~. Recently, alongside features extracted from vulnerable code, the information about a software development process and involved developers have also been extracted to predict SV fixing effort~. Currently, metadata-based and text-based features have been mainly integrated by concatenating their respective feature vectors (e.g.,~\\mbox{}). An alternative yet unexplored way is to build separate models for each feature type and then combine these models using meta-learning (e.g., model stacking~\\mbox{}).", "cites": [4894, 1684, 4891, 7], "cite_extract_rate": 0.17391304347826086, "origin_cites_number": 23, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple cited papers by grouping feature representation methods into three coherent categories and explaining their relevance and application in SV assessment.

DL models also offer solutions to data-related issues such as addressing class imbalance (e.g., deep Siamese network~\\mbox{}) or improving data efficiency (e.g., deep multi-task learning~\\mbox{}).\nWhenever applicable, it is recommended that future work should still consider simple baselines alongside sophisticated ones as simple methods can perform on par with advanced ones~\\mbox{}.\nBesides classification, various prediction models have also been investigated for regression (e.g., predicting exploit time, severity score and fixing time).\nLinear SVM has again been the most commonly used regressor as SV descriptions have usually been the regression input.\nNotably, many studies in the Severity theme did not build regression models to directly obtain the severity score (e.g.,~). Instead, they used the formulas defined by assessment frameworks (e.g., CVSS versions 2/3~ or WIVSS~) to compute the severity score from the base metrics predicted by respective classification models.\nWe argue that more effort should be invested in determining the severity score directly from SV data as these severity formulas can be subjective~\\mbox{}. We also observe that there is still limited use of DL models for regression compared to classification.\nIn addition to supervised (classification/regression) techniques, unsupervised learning has also been considered for extracting underlying patterns of SV data, especially in the Type theme. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)~ has been the most commonly used topic model to identify latent topics/types of SVs without relying on a labeled taxonomy. The identified topics were mapped to the existing SV taxonomies such as CWE~ and OWASP~.\nThe topics generated by topic models like LDA can also be used as features for classification/regression models~ or building topic-wise models to capture local SV patterns~.\nHowever, definite interpretations for unsupervised outputs are challenging to obtain as they usually rely on human judgement~\\mbox{}.", "cites": [4896, 168, 4887, 4886, 4068, 4895, 4883, 326], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 24, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.8}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes information from multiple cited papers to provide a coherent overview of prediction models in vulnerability assessment.

The commonly used evaluation techniques are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:data_driven_elements}.\nThe reviewed studies have mostly used one or multiple validation and/or test sets\\footnote{Validation set(s) helps optimize/tune a model (finding the best task/data-specific hyperparameters), and test set(s) evaluates the optimized/tuned model. Using only validation set(s) means evaluating a model with default/pre-defined hyperparameters.} to evaluate their models, in which each validation/test set has been either randomly or time-based selected. Specifically, k-fold cross-validation has been one of the most commonly used techniques. The number of folds has usually been 5 or 10, but less standard values like 4~ have also been used. However, k-fold cross-validation uses all parts of data at least once for training; thus, there is no hidden test set to evaluate the optimal model with the highest (cross-)validation performance.\nTo address the lack of hidden test set(s), a common practice in the studied papers has been to split a dataset into single training and test sets, sometimes with an additional validation set for tuning hyperparameters to obtain an optimal model. Recently, data has been increasingly split based on the published time of SVs to better reflect the changing nature of ever-increasing SVs~. There have been various ratios for random (e.g., 80:20, 75:25 or 67:33) and time-based (e.g., week/month/year-wise) splits. However, the results reported using single validation/test sets may be unstable (i.e., unreproducible results using different set(s))~.\nTo ensure both the time order and reduce the result randomness, we recommend using multiple splits of training and test sets in combination with time-based validation in each training set.

Thus, future work should also consider real-world development-related issues discussed on developer Q\\&A platforms for automatically assessing and prioritizing SVs.

These findings show the potential of using GitHub discussions to complement the current sources for earlier SV assessment and prioritization.

There are still many opportunities for investigating different few-shot learning techniques for other SV assessment and prioritization tasks. Note that the shared features in few-shot learning can also be enhanced with pretrained models (e.g., BERT~) on another domain/task/project with more labeled data than the current task/project in the SV domain.\n\\textit{Semi-supervised learning} enables training models with limited labeled data yet a large amount of unlabeled data~, potentially leveraging hidden/unlabeled SVs in the wild.

One potential solution to this issue is to perform assessment and prioritization of SVs in code commits. Code commits contain changes made by developers to fix a bug/SV, implement a new feature or refactor code, and new SVs may be introduced in such changes~. Commit-level prediction would allow just-in-time SV assessment and prioritization as soon as SVs are introduced, reducing the waiting time for SV information to be verified and published on security advisories/databases~. It should be noted that report-level prediction is still important for assessing and prioritizing third-party libraries/software, especially the ones without available code (commits), and/or SVs missed by commit-level prediction.\nCVSS~ has been most frequently used for assessing the exploitability, impact and severity levels/score of SVs (see sections~\\ref{sec:exploit_prediction},~\\ref{sec:impact_prediction} and~\\ref{sec:severity_prediction}), but there are increasing concerns that CVSS outputs are still generic. Specifically, Spring et al.~ argued that CVSS tends to provide one-size-fits-all assessment metrics regardless of the context of SVs; i.e., the same SVs in different domains/environments are assigned the same metric values. For instance, banking systems may consider the confidentiality and integrity of databases more important than the availability of web/app interfaces. In the future, alongside CVSS, prediction models should also incorporate the domain/business knowledge to customize the assessment of SVs to a system of interest (e.g., the impact of SVs on critical component(s) and/or the readiness of developers/solutions for mitigating such SVs in the current system). Future case studies with practitioners are also desired to correlate the quantitative performance of models and their usability/usefulness in real-world systems (e.g., reducing more critical SVs yet using fewer resources).", "cites": [4902], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes the idea of using code commits for timely vulnerability assessment, drawing on the concept from Paper 1 (DeepCVA), and integrates it with the broader context of SV data sources.

For example, it is unclear how to assign static CVSS metrics to systems with automatically updated data-driven models~ because adversarial examples for exploitation would likely change after the models are updated.\nSuch ambiguities should be clarified/resolved in future CVSS versions as data-driven systems become more prevalent.\nThe types of SVs in ML/DL models in data-driven systems are also mostly different from the ones provided by CWE~. The difference is mainly because these new SVs do not only emerge from configurations/code as in traditional systems, but also from training data and/or trained models~.
