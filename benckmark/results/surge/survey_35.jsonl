Learning such measures automatically from data is the primary aim of similarity learning. \nSimilarity/Metric learning refers to learning a function to measure the distance or similarity between objects, which is a critical step in many machine learning problems, such as classification, clustering, ranking, etc. For example, in k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classification , a metric is needed for measuring the distance between data points and identifying the nearest neighbors; in many clustering algorithms, similarity measurements between data points are used to determine the clusters. Although there are some general metrics like Euclidean distance that can be used for getting similarity measure between objects represented as vectors, these metrics often fail to capture the specific characteristics of the data being studied, especially for structured data. Therefore, it is essential to find or learn a metric for measuring the similarity of data points involved in the specific task. \nMetric learning has been widely studied in many fields on various data types. For instance, in computer vision, metric learning has been explored on images or videos for image classification, object recognition, visual tracking, and other learning tasks . In information retrieval, such as in search engines, metric learning has been used to determine the ranking of relevant documents to a given query . In this paper, we survey the existing work in similarity learning for graphs, which encode relational structures and are ubiquitous in various domains. \nSimilarity learning for graphs has been studied for many real applications, such as molecular graph classification in chemoinformatics , protein-protein interaction network analysis for disease prediction , binary function similarity search in computer security , multi-subject brain network similarity learning for neurological disorder analysis , etc. In many of these application scenarios, the number of training samples available is often very limited, making it a difficult problem to directly train a classification or prediction model. With graph similarity learning strategies, these applications benefit from pairwise learning that utilizes every pair of training samples to learn a metric for mapping the input data to the target space, which further facilitates the specific learning task. \nIn the past few decades, many techniques have emerged for studying the similarity of graphs. Early on, multiple graph similarity metrics were defined, such as the Graph Edit Distance , Maximum Common Subgraph , and Graph Isomorphism , to address the problem of graph similarity search and graph matching. However, the computation of these metrics is an NP-complete problem in general . Although some pruning strategies and heuristic methods have been proposed to approximate the values and speed up the computation, it is difficult to analyze the computational complexities of the above heuristic algorithms and the sub-optimal solutions provided by them are also unbounded . Therefore, these approaches are feasible only for graphs of relatively small size and in practical applications where these metrics are of primary interest. Thus it is hard to adapt these methods to new tasks. In addition, for other methods that are relatively more efficient like the Weisfeiler-Lehman method in , since it is developed specifically for isomorphism testing without mapping functions, it cannot be applied for general graph similarity learning. More recently, researchers have formulated similarity estimation as a learning problem where the goal is to learn a model that maps a pair of graphs to a similarity score based on the graph representations. For example, graph kernels, such as path-based kernels  and the subgraph matching kernel , were proposed for graph similarity learning.  Traditional graph embedding techniques, such as geometric embedding, are also leveraged for graph similarity learning . \n\\gm{With the emergence of deep learning techniques, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a powerful new tool for learning representations on graphs with various structures for various tasks. The main distinction between GNNs and the traditional graph embedding is that GNNs address graph-related tasks in an end-to-end manner, where the representation learning and the target learning task are conducted jointly , while the graph embedding generally learns graph representations in an isolated stage and the learned representations are then used for the target task. Therefore, the GNN deep models can better leverage the graph features for the specific learning task compared to the graph embedding methods. Moreover, GNNs are easily adapted and extended for various graph related tasks, including deep graph similarity learning tasks in different domains. For instance, in brain connectivity network analysis in neuroscience, community structure among the nodes (i.e. brain regions) within the brain network is an important factor that should be considered when learning node representations for cross-subject similarity analysis. However, none of the traditional graph embedding methods are able to capture such special structure and jointly leverage the learned node representations for similarity learning on brain networks. In , a higher-order GNN model is developed to encode the community-structure of brain networks during the representation learning and leverage it for the similarity learning task on these brain networks. Some more examples from other domains include the GNN-based graph similarity predictive models introduced for chemical compound queries in computational chemistry , and the deep graph matching networks proposed for binary function similarity search and malware detection in computer security .}\nIn this survey paper, we provide a systematic review of the existing work in deep graph similarity learning. Based on the different graph representation learning strategies and how they are leveraged for the deep graph similarity learning task, we propose to categorize deep graph similarity learning models into three groups: Graph Embedding based-methods, GNN-based methods, and Deep Graph Kernel-based methods. Additionally, we sub-categorize the models based on their properties. Table ~\\ref{tab:taxonomy} shows our proposed taxonomy, with some example models for each category as well as the relevant applications. In this survey, we will illustrate how these different categories of models approach the graph similarity learning problem. We will also discuss the loss functions used for the graph similarity learning task.", "cites": [8334, 553, 1655], "cite_extract_rate": 0.11538461538461539, "origin_cites_number": 26, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple cited papers to provide a coherent narrative on the evolution of graph similarity learning, from traditional methods to modern deep learning approaches.

However, it could offer deeper comparative analysis and more nuanced critiques of individual methods for higher insight."}}

This is a general notation for graphs that covers different types of graphs, including unweighted/weighted graphs, undirected/directed graphs, and attributed/non-attributed graphs.\nWe are also assuming a set of graphs as input, $\\mathcal{G} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_n\\}$, and the goal is measure/model their pairwise similarity. This relates to the classical problem of graph isomorphism and its variants. In graph isomorphism~, two graphs $G = (V_G,E_G)$ and $H = (V_H,E_H)$ are isomorphic (i.e., $G \\cong H$), if there is a \\gm{mapping} function $\\pi: V_G \\rightarrow V_H$, such that $(u,v) \\in E_G$ iff $(\\pi(u),\\pi(v)) \\in E_H$. The graph isomorphism is an NP problem, and no efficient algorithms are known for it. Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of the graph isomorphism problem. In subgraph isomorphism, the goal is to answer for two input graphs $G$ and $H$, if there is a subgraph of $G$ ($G' \\subset G$) such that $G'$ is isomorphic to $H$ (i.e., $G' \\cong H$). This is suitable in a setting in which the two graphs have different sizes. The subgraph isomorphism problem has been proven to be NP-complete (unlike the graph isomorphism problem)~. The maximum common subgraph problem is another less-restrictive measure of graph similarity, in which the similarity between two graphs is defined based on the size of the largest common subgraph in the two input graphs. However, this problem is also NP-complete~.\n\\begin{mydef}[\\textbf{Graph Similarity Learning}]\\label{def:gsim}\nLet $\\mathcal{G}$ be an input set of graphs, $\\mathcal{G} = \\{G_1,G_2,\\cdots ,G_n\\}$ where $G_i=(V_i, E_i, \\mathbf{A}_i)$. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ denote a learnable similarity function, such that $\\mathcal{M}: (G_i, G_j) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, for any pair of graphs $G_i, G_j \\in \\mathcal{G}$. Assume $s_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ denote the similarity score computed using $\\mathcal{M}$ between pairs $G_i$ and $G_j$. Then $\\mathcal{M}$ is symmetric if and only if $s_{ij} = s_{ji}$ for any pair of graphs $G_i, G_j \\in \\mathcal{G}$. $\\mathcal{M}$ should satisfy the property that: $s_{ii} >= s_{ij}$ for any pair of graphs $G_i, G_j \\in \\mathcal{G}$. And, $s_{ij}$ is minimum if $G_i$ is the complement of $G_j$, i.e, $G_i = \\Bar{G_j}$, for any graph $G_j \\in \\mathcal{G}$.\n\\end{mydef}\nClearly, graph isomorphism and its related variants (e.g., subgraph isomorphism, maximum common subgraphs, etc.) are focused on measuring the topological equivalence of graphs, which gives rise to a binary similarity measure that outputs $1$ if two graphs are isomorphic and $0$ otherwise. While these methods may sound intuitive, they are actually more restrictive and difficult to compute for large graphs. Here instead, we focus on a relaxed notion of graph similarity that can be measured using machine learning models, where the goal is to learn a model that quantifies the degree of structural similarity and relatedness between two graphs. This is slightly similar to the work done on modeling the structural similarity between nodes in the same graph~. We formally state the definition of graph similarity learning (GSL) in Definition~\\ref{def:gsim}. Note that in the case of deep graph similarity learning, the similarity function $\\mathcal{M}$ is a neural network model that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion.", "cites": [3946, 7762], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides basic notation and definitions for graph similarity learning and briefly mentions related concepts like graph isomorphism and node-based structural similarity.

literature of deep graph similarity learning. As shown in Fig. ~\\ref{fig:taxonomy}, we propose two intuitive taxonomies for categorizing the various deep graph similarity learning methods based on the model architecture and the type of features used in these methods.} \n\\gm{First, we start by discussing the categorization based on which model architecture has been used. There are three main categories of deep graph similarity learning methods (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:model_taxonomy}): (1) graph embedding based methods, which apply graph embedding techniques to obtain node-level or graph-level representations and further use the representations for similarity learning ; (2) graph neural network (GNN) based models, which are based on using GNNs for similarity learning, including GNN-CNNs , Siamese GNNs  and GNN-based graph matching networks ; and (3) deep graph kernels that first map graphs into a new feature space, where kernel functions are defined for similarity learning on graph pairs, including sub-structure based deep kernels  and deep neural network based kernels . In the meantime, different methods may use different types of features in the learning process.}\n\\gm{Second, we discuss the categorization of methods based on the type of features used in them. Existing GSL approaches can be generally grouped into two categories (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:feature_taxonomy}): (1) methods that uses single-graph features\n~;\n(2) methods that uses cross-graph features for similarity learning~. The main difference between these two categories of methods is that for methods using single-graph features, the representation of each graph is learned individually,  while those methods that use cross-graph features allow graphs to learn and propagate features from each other and the cross-graph interaction is leveraged for pairs of graphs.

By minimizing the triplet loss, the distance between graphs from same class (i.e., $d_{ip}$) will be pushed to $0$, and the distance between graphs from different classes (i.e.,$d_{in}$ will be pushed to be greater than $d_{ip} + m$. \nIt is important to consider which loss function would be suitable for the targeted problem when applying these Siamese GNN models for the graph similarity learning task in practice.", "cites": [1244], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 2, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic description of Siamese GCNs for image retrieval, referencing a specific application where images are converted into region adjacency graphs.

In , context-dependent graph kernels are proposed to measure the similarity between graphs for human action recognition in video sequences. Two directed and attributed graphs are constructed to describe the local features with intra-frame relationships and inter-frame relationships, respectively. The graphs are decomposed into a number of primary walk groups with different walk lengths, and a generalized multiple kernel learning algorithm is applied to combine all the context-dependent graph kernels, which further facilitates human action classification. In , a deep model called Neural Graph Matching Network is first introduced for the 3D action recognition problem in the few-shot learning setting. Interaction graphs are constructed from the 3D scenes, where the nodes represent physical entities in the scene and edges represent interactions between the entities. The proposed NGM Networks jointly learn a graph generator and a graph matching metric function in an end-to-end fashion to directly optimize the few-shot learning objective. It has been shown to significantly improve the few-shot 3D action recognition over the holistic baselines. \n\\gm{Another emerging application of graph similarity learning in computer vision is the image matching problem, where the goal is to find consistent correspondences between the sets of features in two images. As introduced at the end of Section 3.2, recently some deep graph matching networks have been developed for the image matching task , where images are first converted to graphs and the image matching problem is then solved as a graph matching problem. In the graph converted from an image, the nodes represent the unary descriptors of annotated feature points in images, and edges encode the pairwise relationships among different feature points in that image. Based on the new graph representation, the feature matching can be reformulated as graph matching problem. However, it is worth noting that, this graph matching is actually the graph node matching, as the goal is to match the nodes between graphs instead of two entire graphs. Therefore, the graph based image matching problem is a special case or a sub-problem of the general graph matching problem. }\n\\gm{The two application problems discussed above are both promising directions of applying deep graph similarity learning models for the practical learning tasks in computer vision.

For example, the 3D human action or motion data can be represented as graphs where the entities are represented as nodes and the actions as edges connecting the entities. Then similarity learning on these graphs is an important problem for action and motion recognition. Moreover, another type of graph is the streaming graph, where both the structure and/or features are continuously changing~. For example, online social networks~. The similarity learning would be important for change/anomaly detection, link prediction, relationship strength prediction, etc. Although some work has proposed variants of GNN models for spatio-temporal graphs , and other learning methods for dynamic graphs~, the similarity learning problem on dynamic and streaming graphs has not been well studied. \\gm{For example, in the multi-subject analysis of task-related fMRI brain networks as mentioned in Section~\\ref{sec:apps_neuro}, for each subject, a set of brain connectivity networks can be collected for a give time period, which forms a spatio-temporal graph. It would be interesting to conduct similarity learning on the spatio-temporal graphs of different subjects to analyze their similarity in cognitive abilities, which is an important problem in the neuroscience field. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing similarity learning methods is able to deal with such spatio-temporal graphs.} The main challenge in such problems is how to leverage the temporal updates of the node-level representations and the interactions between the nodes on these graphs while modeling their similarity.", "cites": [25, 3966, 3967, 3968, 7231, 3969, 3970], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6363636363636364, "origin_cites_number": 11, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a coherent discussion on dynamic and streaming graphs by integrating concepts from several papers, such as spatio-temporal modeling and online sampling.

Little work has been done on metric learning for few-shot learning on graphs, which is an important problem for areas in which data are represented as graphs and data gathering is difficult, for example, brain connectivity network analysis in neuroscience. Since graph data usually has complex structure, how to learn a metric so that it can facilitate generalizing from a few graph examples is a big challenge. Some recent work ~ has begun to explore the few-shot 3D action recognition problem with graph-based similarity learning strategies, where a neural graph matching network is proposed to jointly learn a graph generator and a graph matching metric function to optimize the few-shot learning objective of 3D action recognition. However, since the objective is defined specifically based on the 3D action recognition task, the model can not be directly used for other domains.
