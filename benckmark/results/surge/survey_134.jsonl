For example, as shown in Fig. 1(a), a bibliographic network (i.e., academic network) can be represented by a HG, which consists of four types of nodes (author, paper, venue, and term) and three types of edges (author-write-paper, paper-contain-term and conference-publish-paper); and these basic relations can be further derived for more complex semantics over the HG (e.g., author-write-paper-contain-item). It has been well recognized that HG is a powerful model that is able to embrace rich semantics and structural information in real world data. Therefore, researches on HG data have been experiencing tremendous growth in data mining and machine learning, many of which have been successfully applied in real world systems such as recommendation , text analysis , and cybersecurity . \nDue to the ubiquity of HG data, how to learn embeddings of HG is a key research problem in various graph analysis applications, e.g., node/graph classification , and node clustering . Traditionally, to learn HG embeddings, matrix (e.g., adjacency matrix) factorization methods  have been proposed to generate latent-dimension features in a HG. However, the computational cost of decomposing a large-scale matrix is usually very expensive, and also suffers from its statistical performance drawback . To address this challenge, heterogeneous graph embedding (i.e., heterogeneous graph representation learning), aiming to learn a function that maps input space into a lower-dimension space while preserving the heterogeneous structure and semantics, has drawn considerable attentions in recent years. Although there have been ample studies of embedding technology on homogeneous graphs  which consist of only one type of nodes and edges, these techniques cannot be directly applicable to HGs due to the heterogeneity of HG data. More specifically, \ni) the structure in HG is usually semantic dependent, e.g., meta-path structure , implying that the local structure of one node in HG can be very different when considering different types of relations; \nii) different types of nodes and edges have different attributes, which are usually located in different feature spaces, and thus when designing heterogeneous graph embedding methods, especially heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs), we need to overcome the heterogeneity of attributes to fuse information ;\niii) another one is that HG is usually application dependent: for example, the basic structure of HG usually can be captured by meta-path, however meta-path selection is still challenging in reality, which may need sufficient domain knowledge. \nTo tackle the above issues, various heterogeneous graph embedding methods have been proposed , many of which  have demonstrated the success of heterogeneous graph embedding techniques deployed in real world applications including recommendation systems , malware detection systems , and healthcare systems . \n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{HIN.pdf}\n\t\\caption{An illustrative example of a heterogeneous graph.

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we will thoroughly survey the existing works on heterogeneous graph embedding, including representative methods and techniques, deployed systems in real world applications, and publicly available benchmark datasets as well as open-source code/tools. In particular, (1) we will explore recent progress of heterogeneous graph embedding, by introducing its representative methods and techniques with analysis of their pros and cons; then (2) we will introduce and discuss the transformativeness of existing heterogeneous graph embedding methods that have been successfully deployed in real-world applications; afterwards (3) we will summarize publicly available benchmark datasets and open-source code/tools to facilitate researchers and practitioners for future heterogeneous graph embedding works; and finally (4) we will discuss the additional issues and challenges of heterogeneous graph embedding technique and forecast the future research directions in this area.

In Section 2, we first introduce the HG concepts and discuss the unique challenges of heterogeneous graph embedding due to the heterogeneity. In Section 3, we categorize and introduce heterogeneous graph embedding methods in details according to the information (e.g., structures, attributes, and application dependent domain knowledge) used in the learning process, based on which we analyze their pros and cons and then discuss their applicability. In Section 4, we further summarize the commonly used techniques in the state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding methods.

A HG is defined as a graph $\\mathcal{G}=\\{\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}\\}$, in which $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{E}$ represent the node set and the link set, respectively. Each node $v \\in \\mathcal{V}$ and each link $e \\in \\mathcal{E}$ are associated with their mapping function $\\phi(v): \\mathcal{V} \\to \\mathcal{A}$ and $\\varphi(e): \\mathcal{E} \\to \\mathcal{R}$. $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ denote the node types and link types, respectively, where $\\mathcal{A} + \\mathcal{R} > 2$. The \\textbf{network schema} for $\\mathcal{G}$ is defined as $\\mathcal{S}=(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{R})$, which can be seen as a meta template of a heterogeneous graph $\\mathcal{G}=\\{\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}\\}$ with the node type mapping function $\\phi(v): \\mathcal{V} \\to \\mathcal{A}$ and the link type mapping function $\\varphi(e): \\mathcal{E} \\to \\mathcal{R}$. The network schema is a graph defined over node types $\\mathcal{A}$, with links as relations from $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\\label{HIN}\n\\end{definition}\nHG not only provides the graph structure of the data associations, but also provides a higher-level semantics of the data. An example of HG is illustrated in Fig. \\ref{HIN_fig}(a), which consists of four node types (author, paper, venue, and term) and three link types (author-write-paper, paper-contain-term, and conference-publish-paper); while Fig. \\ref{HIN_fig}(b) illustrates the network schema. Based on a constructed HG, to formulate the semantics of higher-order relationships among entities, meta-path  is further proposed whose definition is given below. \n\\begin{definition}\n\\textbf{Meta-path} . A meta-path $m$ is based on a network schema $\\mathcal{S}$, which is denoted as $m=A_{1}\\stackrel{R_{1}}{\\longrightarrow}A_{2}\\stackrel{R_{2}}{\\longrightarrow} \\cdots \\stackrel{R_{l}}{\\longrightarrow}A_{l+1}$ (simplified to $A_{1}A_{2} \\cdots A_{l+1}$) with node types $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\cdots ,A_{l+1} \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and link types $R_{1}, R_{2}, \\cdots R_{l} \\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n\\label{meta-path}\n\\end{definition}\nNote that different meta-paths describe semantic relationships in different views. For example, the meta-path of ``APA'' indicates the co-author relationship and ``APCPA'' represents the co-conference relation. Both of them can be used to formulate the relatedness over authors. Although meta-path can be used to depict the relatedness over entities, it fails to capture a more complex relationship, such as motifs . To address this challenge, meta-graph  is proposed to use a directed acyclic graph of entity and relation types to capture more complex relationship between two HG entities, defined as follows.\n\\begin{definition}\n\\textbf{Meta-graph} . A meta-graph $\\mathcal{T}$ can be seen as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) composed of multiple meta-paths with common nodes.\nFormally, meta-graph is defined as $\\mathcal{T}=(V_{\\mathcal{T}}, E_{\\mathcal{T}})$, where $V_{\\mathcal{T}}$ is a set of nodes and $E_{\\mathcal{T}}$ is a set of links. For any node $v \\in V_{\\mathcal{T}}, \\phi(v) \\in \\mathcal{A}$; for any link $e \\in E_{\\mathcal{T}}, \\varphi(e) \\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n\\label{metagraph}\n\\end{definition}\nAn example meta-graph is shown in Fig. \\ref{HIN}(d), which can be regarded as the combination of meta-path ``APA'' and ``APCPA'', reflecting a high-order similarity of two nodes. Note that a meta-graph can be symmetric or asymmetric . To learn embeddings of HG data, we formalize the problem of heterogeneous graph embedding as follow.\n\\begin{definition}\n\\textbf{Heterogeneous graph embedding} . Heterogeneous graph embedding aims to learn a function $\\Phi: \\mathcal{V} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that embeds the nodes $v \\in \\mathcal{V}$ in HG into a low-dimensional Euclidean space with $d \\ll |\\mathcal{V}|$.\n\\label{HIN embedding}\n\\end{definition}\nTable 1 summarizes symbols used through this paper. \n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Notations and Explanations}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n    \\toprule\n    Notations & Explainations \\\\\n    \\midrule\n\t$d$\t\t\t\t\t\t& dimension of node embeddings \\\\\n\t$N$\t\t\t\t\t\t& Number of nodes \\\\\n\t$m$\t\t\t\t\t\t& Meta-path\\\\\n\t$\\mathbf{h}_{i}$\t\t& Attributes or embeddings of node $i$ \\\\\n    $\\mathbf{M}_{r}$\t\t& Relation-specific matrix of relation $r$ \\\\\n\t$w_{ij}$\t\t\t\t& Weight of link between node $i$ and node $j$ \\\\\n \t$S_{r}$\t\t\t\t\t& Heterogeneous similarity function with relation $r$ \\\\\n    $C_{t}(i)$\t\t\t\t& Context nodes of node $i$ with type $t$ \\\\\n \t$\\mathcal{N}_{i}$\t& Neighbors of node $i$ \\\\\n \t$\\sigma$\t\t\t\t& Sigmoid function \\\\\n \t$\\odot$\t\t\t\t\t& Hadamard product \\\\\n \t$\\oplus$\t\t\t\t& Concatenation operator\\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n  \\label{notations}\n\\end{table}", "cites": [1421], "cite_extract_rate": 0.16666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a factual summary of basic concepts in heterogeneous graph embedding, including definitions of HG, meta-path, and meta-graph.

Due to the heterogeneity, heterogeneous graph embedding imposes more challenges, which are illustrated below.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{HINRL_mind.pdf}\n\t\\caption{An overview of heterogeneous graph embedding from the perspective of used information.}\n\t\\label{overview}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item \\textbf{Complex structure} (the complex HG structure caused by multiple types of nodes and edges). In a homogeneous graph, the fundamental structure can be considered as the so-called first-order, second-order, and even higher-order structure . All these structures are well defined and have good intuition. However, the structure in HG will dramatically change depending on the selected relations. Let's still take the academic network in Fig. 1(a) as an example, the neighbors of one paper will be authors with the ``write\" relation, while with ``contain\" relation, the neighbors become terms. Complicating things further, the combination of these relations, which can be considered as a higher-order structure in HG, will result in different and more complicated structures. Therefore, how to efficiently and effectively preserve these complex structures is of great challenge in heterogeneous graph embedding, while current efforts have been made towards the meta-path structure  and meta-graph structure , etc.\n\t\\item \\textbf{Heterogeneous attributes} (the fusion problem caused by the heterogeneity of attributes). Since the nodes and edges in a homogeneous graph have the same type, each dimension of the node or edge attributes has the same meaning. In this situation, node can directly fuse the attributes of its neighbors. However, in heterogeneous graph, the attributes of different types of nodes and edges may have different meanings . For example, the attributes of author can be the research fields, while paper may use keywords as attributes. Therefore, how to overcome the heterogeneity of attributes and effectively fuse the attributes of neighbors poses another challenge in heterogeneous graph embedding.\n\t\\item \\textbf{Application  dependent}. HG is closely related to the real world applications, while many practical problems remain unsolved. For example, constructing an appropriate HG may require sufficient domain knowledge in a real world application. Also, meta-path and/or meta-graph are widely used to capture the structure of HG. However, unlike homogeneous graph, where the structure (e.g., the first-order and second-order structure) is well defined, meta-path selection may also need prior knowledge. Furthermore, to better facilitate the real world applications, we usually need to elaborately encode the side information (e.g., node attributes)  or more advanced domain knowledge  to the heterogeneous graph embedding process. \n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [248, 282, 217, 1422, 218, 1419, 1423], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5384615384615384, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of the challenges in HG embedding, drawing on multiple cited papers to highlight issues like complex structure, heterogeneous attributes, and application dependency.

Accordingly, the homogeneous graph embedding pays more attention on higher-order graph structures, for example, second-order structures , high-order structures  and community structures .\nHowever, one typical characteristic of HG is that it contains multiple relations among nodes, which inevitably needs to consider the heterogeneity of graph. Therefore, an important direction of heterogeneous graph embedding is to learn semantic information from the graph structures. In this section, we review the typical heterogeneous graph embedding methods based on the basic HG structures, including link (i.e., edge), meta-path, and subgraph. Link is the observed relation between two nodes, meta-path is composed of different types of links and subgraph represents the tiny sub-structure of graph.

Different from homogeneous graph, link in HG has different types and contains different semantics. To distinguish various types of links, one classical idea is to deal with them in different metric spaces, rather than a unified metric space. A representative work is PME , which treats each link type as a relation and uses a relation-specific matrix to transform the nodes into different metric spaces. In this way, nodes connected by different types of links can be close to each other in different metric spaces, thus capturing the heterogeneity of the graph. The distance function is defined as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tS_{r}(v_{i},v_{j})=w_{ij}\\left\\| \\mathbf{M}_{r} \\mathbf{h}_{i} - \\mathbf{M}_{r} \\mathbf{h}_{j} \\right\\|_{2},\n\\label{eq_PME}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times 1}$ denote the node embeddings of node $i$ and node $j$, respectively; $\\mathbf{M}_{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ is the projection matrix of relation $r$; and $w_{ij}$ represents the weight of link between node $i$ and node $j$. Note that Eq. \\ref{eq_PME} can be seen as a metric learning function:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\left\\| \\mathbf{M}_{r} ( \\mathbf{h}_{i} - \\mathbf{h}_{j} ) \\right\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{ ( \\mathbf{h}_{i} - \\mathbf{h}_{j} )^\\top \\mathbf{M}_{r}^\\top \\mathbf{M}_{r} ( \\mathbf{h}_{i} - \\mathbf{h}_{j} )},\n\\label{eq_metric}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{M}_{r}^\\top \\mathbf{M}_{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ is the metric matrix of Mahalanobis distance . PME considers the relations between nodes when minimizing the distance of them, thus capturing the heterogeneity of graph. The loss function is the margin-based triple loss function, which requires a distance between the positive and negative samples:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tL=\\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}}\\sum_{(v_{i},v_{j}) \\in E_{r}}\\sum_{(v_{i},v_{k}) \\notin E_{r}}[\\xi + S_{r}(v_{i},v_{j})^2 - S_{r}(v_{i},v_{k})^2]_{+}\n\t\\label{loss_PME}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\xi$ denotes the margin, $E_{r}$ represents the positive links of relation $r$, and $[z]_{+}=\\max(z,0)$. Through Eq. \\ref{loss_PME}, PME makes the node pairs connected by relation $r$ closer to each other than the node pairs without relation $r$.\nBy exploiting the relation-specific matrix to capture the link heterogeneity, different from PME, other methods have been proposed aiming to maximize the similarity of two nodes connected by specific relations. For example, EOE  and HeGAN  use the relation-specific matrix $\\mathbf{M}_{r}$ to calculate the similarity between two nodes, which can be formulated as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{EOE}\n\tS_{r}(v_{i}, v_{j})=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left\\{ -\\mathbf{h}^{\\top}_{i} \\mathbf{M}_{r} \\mathbf{h}_{j} \\right\\}}.\n\\end{equation}\nMore specifically, EOE is proposed to learn embeddings for coupled heterogeneous graphs, which consist of two different but related sub-graphs. It divides the links in HG into intra-graph links and inter-graph links. Intra-graph link connects two nodes with the same type, and inter-graph link connects two nodes with different types. To capture the heterogeneity in inter-graph link, EOE utilizes Eq. \\ref{EOE} as the similarity function of two nodes. Different from EOE, HeGAN uses generative adversarial networks (GAN)  to learn node embeddings for heterogeneous graph. It uses Eq. \\ref{EOE} as a discriminator to determine whether the node embeddings are produced by the generator. Through the game between discriminator and generator, HeGAN can learn more robust node embeddings.\nThe previously discussed methods mainly preserve the link structure based on either the distance or similarity function on node embeddings, while AspEM  and HEER  aim to maximize the probability of existing links. The heterogeneous similarity function is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tS_{r}=\\frac{\\exp(\\bm{\\mu}^{\\top}_{r}\\mathbf{g}_{ij})}{\\sum_{\\tilde{i} \\in E^{r}_{\\tilde{i}j}} \\exp(\\bm{\\mu}^{\\top}_{r}\\mathbf{g}_{\\tilde{i}j}) + \\sum_{\\tilde{j} \\in E^{r}_{i\\tilde{j}}} \\exp(\\bm{\\mu}^{\\top}_{r}\\mathbf{g}_{i\\tilde{j}})},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\bm{\\mu}_{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times 1}$ is the embedding of relation $r$; $\\mathbf{g}_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times 1}$ is the embedding of link between node $i$ and node $j$; $\\mathbf{g}_{ij} = \\mathbf{h}_{i} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{j}$ and $\\odot$ denotes the Hadamard product; and $E^{r}_{\\tilde{i}j}$ is the set of negative links, which indicates that there is no link between node $\\tilde{i}$ and node $j$. \nIt can be seen that $\\bm{\\mu}^{\\top}_{r}\\mathbf{g}_{ij}$ measures the closeness between link and its corresponding type. Maximizing $S_{r}$ enlarges the closeness between the existing links and their corresponding types, thus capturing the heterogeneity of the graph.\nIn addition to the above methods, there are some methods that draw on techniques from other fields. Similar to the idea of TransE , MELL  uses the equation 'head + relation = tail' to learn the node embeddings for heterogeneous graph. PTE  decomposes the heterogeneous graph into multiple bipartite graphs and employs LINE , which preserves the first- and second-order structures of graph, to learn node embeddings for each bipartite graph. MNE  assigns multiple embeddings for each node and uses a skip-gram technique  to represent information of multi-type relations into a unified space.\nIn summary, we can roughly divide the link-based heterogeneous graph embedding methods into two categories: one is to explicitly preserve the proximity of links ; the other is to preserve the proximity of nodes, which utilizes the information of links implicitly . These two types of methods both make use of the first-order information of HG.", "cites": [1155, 1684, 282, 1425, 1424], "cite_extract_rate": 0.38461538461538464, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes several methods (PME, EOE, HeGAN, AspEM, HEER, MELL, PTE, MNE) and connects their approaches through the shared goal of preserving link-based structures in heterogeneous graphs, highlighting the use of relation-specific matrices and first-order proximity. It provides some critical evaluation by contrasting how different methods achieve their goals (e.g., distance-based vs. similarity-based vs. probabilistic). It abstracts by grouping the methods into two broad categories and identifying the use of first-order information as a common principle, though it does not fully develop a meta-level framework."}}

In fact, the higher-order relation, describing more complex semantic information, is also critical for heterogeneous graph embedding.\nFor example, in Fig. \\ref{HIN}(a), the first-order relation can only reflect the similarity of author-paper, paper-term and paper-venue. While the similarity of author-author, paper-paper and author-conference cannot be well captured. Therefore, the high-order relation is introduced to measure more complex similarity. Because the number of high-order relations is very large, in order to reduce complexity, we usually choose the higher-order relations with rich semantics, called meta-path. In this section, we will introduce some representative meta-path-based heterogeneous graph embedding methods, which can be divided into two categories: random walk-based methods  and hybrid relation-based methods .\nRandom walk-based methods usually use meta-path to guide random walk on a HG, so that the generated node sequence contains rich semantic information.

Then  introduces a negative sampling strategy to reduce the computation. Hence, Eq. \\ref{mpsim} can be approximated as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\log\\sigma(\\mathbf{h}_{c_{t}} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{v}) + \\sum_{q=1}^{Q} \\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{v}^{q} \\sim P(\\tilde{v})} \\left[ \\log\\sigma \\left(- \\mathbf{h}_{\\tilde{v}^{q}} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{v} \\right) \\right],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function, and $P(\\tilde{v})$ is the distribution in which the negative node $\\tilde{v}^{q}$ is sampled for $Q$ times. Through the strategy of negative sampling, the time complexity is greatly reduced. However, when choosing the negative samples, metapath2vec does not consider the types of nodes, i.e., different types of nodes are from the same distribution $P(\\tilde{v})$. It further designs metapath2vec++, which samples the negative nodes of the same type as the central node, i.e., $\\tilde{v}_{t}^{q} \\sim P(\\tilde{v}_{t})$. The formulation can be rewritten as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\log\\sigma(\\mathbf{h}_{c_{t}} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{v}) + \\sum_{q=1}^{Q} \\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{v}_{t}^{q} \\sim P(\\tilde{v}_{t})} \\left[ \\log\\sigma \\left(- \\mathbf{h}_{\\tilde{v}_{t}^{q}} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{v} \\right) \\right].\n\\end{equation}\nAfter minimizing the objective function, metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ can capture both structural information and semantic information effectively and efficiently.\nBased on metapath2vec, a series of variants have been proposed.\nSpacey  designs a heterogeneous spacey random walk to unify different meta-paths with a second-order hyper-matrix to control the transition probability among different node types. JUST  proposes a random walk method with Jump and Stay strategies, which can flexibly choose to change or maintain the type of the next node in the random walk without meta-path. BHIN2vec  proposes an extended skip-gram technique to balance the various types of relations. It treats heterogeneous graph embedding as a multiple relation-based tasks, and balances the influence of different relations on node embeddings by adjusting the training ratio of different tasks. HHNE  conducts the meta-path guided random walk in hyperbolic spaces , where the similarity between nodes can be measured using hyperbolic distance. In this way, some properties of HG, e.g., hierarchical and power-law structure, can be naturally reflected in the learned node embeddings.\nDifferent from random walk-based methods that learn structural and semantic information from generated node sequences, some methods use the combination of first-order relation and high-order relation (i.e., meta-path) to capture the heterogeneity of HG. We call these work as hybrid relation-based methods. A typical work is HIN2vec  (shown in Fig. \\ref{HIN2vec}), which carries out multiple relation prediction tasks jointly to learn the embeddings of nodes and meta-paths.\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{HIN2vec.pdf}\n\\caption{The architecture of HIN2vec. Through the parameter matrices $\\mathbf{W}_{I}, \\mathbf{W}_{J}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{R}$, the one-hot vectors of node $i$, node $j$ and relation $r$ are projected into dense vectors. And these three vectors are fused by a neural network to predict whether node $i$ and $j$ are connected by relation $r$.}\n\\label{HIN2vec}\n\\end{figure}\nThe purpose of HIN2vec is to predict whether two nodes are connected by a meta-path, which can be seen as a multi-label classification task. As illustrated in Fig. \\ref{HIN2vec}, given two nodes $i$ and $j$, HIN2vec uses the following function to compute their similarity under the hybrid relation $r$:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tS_{r}(v_i, v_j)=\\sigma(\\sum \\mathbf{W}_{I}\\vec{i} \\odot \\mathbf{W}_{J}\\vec{j} \\odot f_{01}(\\mathbf{W}_{R}\\vec{r})),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\vec{i}, \\vec{j}$ and $\\vec{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$ denote the one-hot vectors of nodes and relation, respectively; $\\mathbf{W}_{I}, \\mathbf{W}_{J}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times N}$ are the mapping matrices; and $f_{01}(\\cdot)$ is a regularization function, which limits the embedding values between 0 and 1. The loss function is a binary cross-entropy loss:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tE^{r}_{ij}\\log S_{r}(v_i, v_j) + [1-E^{r}_{ij}]\\log [1-S_{r}(v_i, v_j)],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $E^{r}_{ij}$ denotes the set of positive links. After minimizing the loss function, HIN2vec can learn the embedding of nodes and relations (meta-paths). Besides, in the relation set $R$, it contains not only the first-order structures (e.g., A-P relation) but also the high-order structures (e.g., A-P-A relation). Therefore, the node embeddings can capture different semantics.\nRHINE  is another hybrid relation-based method, which designs different distance functions for different relations, thus enhancing the expressive power of node embeddings. It divides the relations into two categories: Affiliation Relations (ARs) and Interaction Relations (IRs). For ARs, a Euclidean distance function is introduced; while for IRs, RHINE proposes a translation-based distance function. Through the combination of these two distance functions, RHINE can learn relation structure-aware heterogeneous node embeddings.\nIn sum, we can find that random walk-based methods mainly exploit meta-path guided strategy for heterogeneous graph embedding; while hybrid relation-based methods regard a meta-path as high-order relation and learn meta-path based embeddings simultaneously. Compared with random walk-based methods, hybrid relation-based methods can simultaneously integrate multiple meta-paths into heterogeneous graph embedding flexibly.", "cites": [1426, 1684, 1427, 8452], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4444444444444444, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a coherent synthesis of path-based HG embedding methods by categorizing them into random walk-based and hybrid relation-based approaches.

Incorporating subgraphs into graph embedding can significantly improve the ability of capturing complex structural relationships. In this section, we introduce two widely used subgraphs in HG: one is metagraph, which reflects the high-order similarity between nodes ; the other is the hyperedge\\footnotemark[1], which connects a series of closely related nodes and preserves the indecomposablity among them .\n\\footnotetext[1]{In this paper, we treat the hyperedge as a special kind of subgraph.}\nZhang \\emph{et al.} propose metagraph2vec , which uses a metagraph-guided random walk to generate heterogeneous node sequence. \nThen the heterogeneous skip-gram technique  is employed to learn the node embeddings. Based on this strategy, metagraph2vec can capture the rich structural information and high-order similarity among nodes.\nDifferent from metagraph2vec that only uses metagraphs in the pre-processing step (i.e., metagraph-guided random walk), mg2vec  aims to learn the embeddings for metagraphs and nodes jointly, so that the metagraphs can join the learning process. It first enumerates the metagraphs and then preserves the proximity between nodes and metagraphs:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tP(\\mathbf{M}_{i}|v)=\\frac{\\exp (\\mathbf{M}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{v})}{\\sum_{M_{j} \\in \\mathcal{M}} \\exp (\\mathbf{M}_{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{v})},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{M}_{i}$ is the embedding of metagraph $i$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ denotes the set of metagraphs. Clearly, $P(M_{i}|v)$ represents the first-order relationship between the nodes and its subgraphs. Further, mg2vec preserves the proximity between node pair and its subgraph to capture the second-order information:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tP(\\mathbf{M}_{i}|u, v)=\\frac{\\exp (\\mathbf{M}_{i} \\cdot f(\\mathbf{h}_{u}, \\mathbf{h}_{v}))}{\\sum_{M_{j} \\in \\mathcal{M}} \\exp (\\mathbf{M}_{j} \\cdot f(\\mathbf{h}_{u}, \\mathbf{h}_{v}))},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $f(\\cdot)$ is a neural network to learn the embeddings of node pairs.\nThrough preserving the first-order and second-order proximity between nodes and metagraphs, mg2vec can capture the structural information and the similarity between nodes and metagraphs.\nDHNE  is a typical hyperedge-based graph embedding method. Specifically, it designs a novel deep model to produce a non-linear tuple-wise similarity function while capturing the local and global structures of a given HG. Taking a hyperedge with three nodes $a, b$ and $c$ as an example. The first layer of DHNE is an autoencoder, which is used to learn latent embeddings and preserve the second-order structures of graph . The second layer is a fully connected layer with embedding concatenated:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\mathbf{L}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{a}\\mathbf{h}_{a} \\oplus \\mathbf{W}_{b}\\mathbf{h}_{b} \\oplus \\mathbf{W}_{c}\\mathbf{h}_{c}),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{L}$ denotes the embedding of the hyperedge; $\\mathbf{h}_{a}, \\mathbf{h}_{b}$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times 1}$ are the embeddings of node $a$, $b$ and $c$ learn by the autoencoder. $\\mathbf{W}_{a}, \\mathbf{W}_{b}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d' \\times d}$ are the transformation matrices for different node types. Finally, the third layer is used to calculate the indecomposability of the hyperedge:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\mathcal{P}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{W}*\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{b}),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}$ denote the indecomposability of the hyperedge; $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times 3d'}$ and $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times 1}$ are the weight matrix and bias, respectively. A higher value of $\\mathcal{P}$ means these nodes are from the existing hyperedges, otherwise it should be small.\nHEBE  is another hyperedge-based method, which aims to maximize the proximity between the node and the hyperedge it belongs to. After maximizing the proximity, HEBE can preserve the similarity of nodes within the same hyperedge, while reduce the similarity of nodes from different hyperedges. Besides,  proposes hyper-path-based random walk to preserve both the structural information and indecomposability of the hyper-graphs.\nCompared with the structures of link and meta-path, subgraph (with two representative forms of meta-graph and hyperedge) usually contains much higher order structural and semantic information. However, one obstacle of subgraph-based heterogeneous graph embedding methods is the high complexity of subgraph.

Node-level attention aims to utilize self-attention mechanism  to learn the importances of neighbors in a certain meta-path:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\alpha_{ij}^{m}=\\frac{\\exp(\\sigma(\\mathbf{a}_{m}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot [\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{'} \\| \\mathbf{h}_{j}^{'}]))}{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{N}_{i}^{m}} \\exp(\\sigma(\\mathbf{a}_{m}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot [\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{'} \\| \\mathbf{h}_{k}^{'}]))},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}_{i}^{m}$ is the neighbors of node $i$ in meta-path $m$, $\\alpha_{ij}^{m}$ is the weight of node $j$ to node $i$ under meta-path $m$.

Because different meta-paths capture different semantic information of HG, a semantic-level attention mechanism is designed to calculated the importance of meta-paths. Given a set of meta-paths $\\{m_{0},m_{1}, \\cdots, m_{P}\\}$, after feeding node features into node-level attention, it has $P$ semantic-specific node embeddings $\\{\\mathbf{H}_{m_{0}},\\mathbf{H}_{m_{1}}, \\cdots, \\mathbf{H}_{m_{P}}\\}$. To effectively aggregate different semantic embeddings, HAN designs a semantic-level attention mechanism:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tw_{m_{i}}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{V}|}\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{V}}\\mathbf{q}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot \\tanh(\\mathbf{W} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{i}^{m} + \\mathbf{b}),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d' \\times d}$ and $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d' \\times 1}$ denote the weight matrix and bias of the MLP, respectively. $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d' \\times 1}$ is the semantic-level attention vector. In order to prevent the node embeddings from being too large, HAN uses the softmax function to normalize $w_{m_{i}}$. Hence, the semantic-level aggregation is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\mathbf{H}=\\sum_{i=1}^{P}\\beta_{m_{i}} \\cdot \\mathbf{H}_{m_{i}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\beta_{m_{i}}$ denotes the normalized $w_{m_{i}}$, which represents the semantic importance. $\\mathbf{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ denotes the final node embeddings. Finally, a task-specific layer is used to fine-tune the node embeddings with a small number of labels and the embeddings $\\mathbf{H}$ can be used in the downstream tasks, such as node clustering and link prediction. HAN is the first to extend GNN to the heterogeneous graph and design a hierarchical attention mechanism, which can capture both structural and semantic information.\nSubsequently, a series of attention-based HGNNs was proposed . MAGNN  designs intra-metapath aggregation and inter-metapath aggregation. The former samples some meta-path instances surrounding the target node and uses an attention layer to learn the importance of different instances, and the latter aims to learn the importance of different meta-paths. HetSANN  and HGT  treat one type of node as query to calculate the importance of other types of nodes around it, through which the method can not only capture the interactions among different types of nodes, but also assign different weights to neighbors during aggregation.  uses meta-paths as virtual edges to enhance the performance of graph attention operator.\nIn addition, there are some HGNNs that focus on other issues. NSHE  proposes to incorporate network schema, instead of meta-path, in aggregating neighborhood information. GTN  aims to automatically identify the useful meta-paths and high-order links in the process of learning node embeddings.

Therefore, some neural network-based methods are proposed.\nOne of the most important techniques is attention mechanism, which aims to find the important users and items in HG based recommendation.\nMCRec  designs a neural co-attention mechanism to capture the relationship between user, item and meta-path. Specifically, it uses the users and items to find the important meta-paths. Meanwhile, the important meta-paths are used to find the important users and items in recommendation. Through this mutual selective attention mechanism, MCRec can not only learn embeddings of users, items and meta-paths, but also capture the complex interactions among them.\nNeuACF  and HueRec  first calculate multiple meta-path-based commuting matrices, where each row represents the user-user similarity or item-item similarity. Then an attention mechanism is designed to learn the importance of different meta-path-based commuting matrices, so as to capture different semantic information.\nAnother type of important techniques is graph neural networks.\nPGCN  converts the user-item interaction sequences into item-item graph, user-item graph and user-sequence graph. Then it designs a HGNN to propagate user and item information in the three graphs, so as to capture the collaborative filtering signals.\nMEIRec  focuses on the problem of intent recommendation in E-commerce, which aims to automatically recommend user intent according to user historical behaviors. It constructs a user-item-query heterogeneous graph and designs a meta-path-guided HGNN to learn the embedding of users, items and queries, which can capture the intent of users.\nGNewsRec  and GNUD  are designed for news recommendation. They consider both the content information of news and the collaborative information between users and news.\n employs graph convolutional network on heterogeneous graphs for basket recommendation.", "cites": [1417, 1010, 1432, 1421, 1419], "cite_extract_rate": 0.29411764705882354, "origin_cites_number": 17, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes the cited works by categorizing HG embedding methods for recommendation into distinct types (e.g., random walk, matrix factorization, neural network-based).

For example, finding potential authors of a given paper or identifying users in cross-platform.\nCurrently, two representative identification applications, author identification  and user identification , have been studied based on heterogeneous graph embedding.\nAuthor identification aims to find the potential authors for an anonymous paper in the academic network. Camel  aims to consider both the content information, e.g., the text of papers, and context information, e.g., the co-occurrence of paper and author. For content information, it designs a content encoder to learn embeddings from the abstract of paper and a metric-based loss function is used to learn the pair-wise relations between authors and papers:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\mathcal{L}_{Metric}=\\xi + \\|f(\\mathbf{h}_{v})-\\mathbf{h}_{u}\\|^{2} - \\|f(\\mathbf{h}_{v})-\\mathbf{h}_{u^{'}}\\|^{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\xi$ is the margin, $f(\\cdot)$ represents the content encoder and $\\mathbf{h}_{v}$, $\\mathbf{h}_{u}$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{u^{'}}$ denote the attributes of paper, positive author and negative author, respectively.\nFor context information, a meta-path guided walk integrative learning module (MWIL) is proposed to preserve the graph structures:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\mathcal{L}_{MWIL}=-\\log \\sigma[f(\\mathbf{h}_{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{u}] - \\log \\sigma[-f(\\mathbf{h}_{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{u^{'}}].\n\\end{equation}\nIt is worth noting that $\\mathcal{L}_{MWIL}$ is a special skip-gram technique, which aims to preserve the proximity of positive author $u$ of paper $v$ within a walk length.\nThrough optimizing $\\mathcal{L}_{Metric}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{MWIL}$ jointly, Camel considers both the heterogeneous graph structures and the pair-wise relation of author-paper.\nSimilar to the idea of Camel, PAHNE  considers the pair-wise relations and TaPEm  maximizes the proximity between the paper-author pair and the context path around them.\nCompared with author identification, user identification does not contain the pair-wise relation, i.e., user and paper. Therefore, it focuses on learning discriminating user embeddings with weak supervision information so that the target users can be identified more easily. Player2vec , AHIN2vec  and Vendor2vec  are the principal methods.\nThey can be summarized as a general framework: first, some advanced neural networks, e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), are used to learn preliminary node embeddings from the raw features. Then the preliminary node embeddings will be propagated on the graphs, constructed by different meta-paths, to utilize the neighborhood information.\nFinally, a semi-supervised loss function is used to make the node embeddings contain application-specific information.

There are also some other methods that do not belong to the existing categories. Here, we briefly introduce them.\nThe first is incorporating HG into natural language processing (NLP). Due to the multiple elements in the corpus, e.g., words, entities, sentences or paragraphs, many NLP tasks can be modeled as HG naturally. Graph-to-sequence (Graph2Seq) learning is an important topic in NLP, which aims to transform the graph-structured embeddings to word sequences for text generation . AMR-to-text generation is a typical Graph2Seq task. It generates text from the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, where nodes represent the semantic concepts in the text and edges denote the relations between concepts. In order to learn useful information from the AMR graph, Yao \\emph{et al.}  treat AMR graph as a heterogeneous graph and design a heterogeneous graph encoder to learn the semantic information among the concepts. Besides, Hu \\emph{et al.}  propose HGAT for short text classification, which treats the topic, entities and documents as a HG and designs a hierachical attention mechanism to learn the similarity among short texts. GNewsRec  and GNUD  use HG to model the collaborative filtering between news and users in news recommendation task.  incorporates HG into topic model for aspect mining.  uses HG in fake new detection.\nSimilar to NLP, multi-modal data can also be modeled by HG due to the various data forms, e.g., text, images or videos. The potential dependencies and connections among multi-model data can be modeled by HG easily. Therefore, some methods try to use heterogeneous graph embedding to capture the potential dependencies and connections. For example, Community Question Answering (CQA) aims to recommend the suitable answers for each question. Because the answers and questions may contain text and pictures,  treats the answers and question as a heterogeneous graph to capture the potential connections, thus making the state-of-the-art performance.\nBesides, graph embedding in hyperbolic space has received widespread attention . Because whether Euclidean spaces are the optimal isometric spaces is still an unsolved problem, exploring heterogeneous graph embedding in the hyperbolic spaces is a meaningful research direction.  shows that hyperbolic spaces can capture the hierarchical and power-law structure of the heterogeneous graph, which provides a theoretical guarantee for the future work to some extent.\nMoreover, HG embedding are also widely used to model many other tasks, such as entity set expansion , basket recommendation , event categorization  and social network .", "cites": [210, 1432, 7011, 1436, 1435, 1434, 7216], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3888888888888889, "origin_cites_number": 18, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 1.8}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section briefly introduces several methods that incorporate heterogeneous graphs into diverse application domains, such as NLP, multi-modal data, and hyperbolic embedding. However, it lacks synthesis by not deeply connecting or categorizing these methods within a broader framework. There is minimal critical analysis or evaluation of the cited works, and abstraction is limited to only surface-level observations about the general utility of HG in these contexts."}}

Specifically, from the left to right, we gradually coarsen the properties of each method, so as to summarize their commonalities.\nThe first two columns indicate whether the method has inductive capability and whether it needs labels for training. We can see that most message passing-based methods have the inductive capability because they can update the node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information. But they need additional labels to guide the training process.\nThe middle two columns show the information and task in each method. It can be seen that most deep learning-based methods are proposed for HG with attributes or specific application, while the shallow model-based methods are mainly designed for the use of structures.\nOne possible reason is that HG with attributes or specific applications usually needs to introduce additional information or domain knowledge. However, modeling the domain knowledge may be complicated, and the relationship with HG may also need to be described carefully. Deep model provides a more powerful support for this kind of complex modeling, and it helps to make better progress in the complex application scenarios. Meanwhile, the emerging HGNNs can naturally integrate graph structures and attributes, so it is more suitable for the complex scenes and content.\nThe last two columns summarize the techniques used in HG embedding and their characteristics. Shallow models are easy to parallel. But they are two-stage training, i.e., the embeddings are not relevant to the downstream tasks, and the memory cost is heavy. On the contrary, deep models are end-to-end training and require less memory space. Besides, message passing-based techniques are good at encoding structures and attributes simultaneously, and integrating different semantic information. Compared with message passing-based techniques, encoder-decoder-based techniques are weak in fusing information due to the lack of messaging mechanism. But they are more flexible to introduce different objective function through different decoders. Adversarial-based methods prefer to utilize the negative samples to enhance the robustness of the embeddings. But the choice of negative samples has a huge influence on the performance, thus leading higher variances .\nIt is worth noting that we also list the complexity of each techniques, where $\\tau$ is the number of random walks, $l$ is the length of random walk, $k$ is the windows size in skip-gram  and $n_{s}$ is the number of samples. The complexity of random walk technique consists of two parts: random walk and skip-gram, both of which are linear with the number of nodes. Decomposition technique needs to divide HGs into sub-graphs according to the type of edges, so the complexity is linear with the number of edges, which is higher than random walk. Message passing technique mainly uses node-level and semantic-level attention to learn node embeddings, so its complexity is related to the number of nodes and node types. As for the encoder-decoder technique, the complexity of encoder is related to the number of nodes, while decoder is usually used to preserve the network structures, so it is linear with the number of edges. Adversarial technique needs to generate the negative samples for each node, so the complexity is related to the number of nodes and negative samples.", "cites": [1684], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 2, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple HG embedding techniques by categorizing them based on properties like inductive capability, use of labels, and the types of information they model.

It plays an important role in social economy development. Usually, large-scale heterogeneous objects and interactions, such as users, items, and shops, are involved in an e-commerce platform. Therefore, HG is a powerful and nature network analysis paradigm to model such complex data. HG embedding has been applied to various important services and tasks in e-commerce, such as item recommendation, intent recommendation, user profiling, and fraudster detection.\n\\par Recommendation is an important service of an e-commerce platform. A simple recommendation scenario primarily considers the interactions of users and items. However, due to the real business demands in e-commerce, it is highly desirable to comprehensively model users and items. HG can be used to model the interactions among users, items, and their auxiliary information~ . As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:E-commerce HIN}, the HG constructed by IntentGC~  is composed of user part and item part, and each part models the corresponding heterogeneous relationships. IntentGC translates the original HG as a multi-relation graph of users and items and develops a multi-relation graph convolution method to learn node embeddings. Besides integrating\nthe separate auxiliary information of user and item parts, GATNE~  distinguishes the interactions between user and item pairs as multiple types, models this scenario as an attributed multiplex heterogeneous graph and proposes an unified embedding method that captures both attribute and edge information. More recently, to solve the interaction sparsity problem, Xu~\\emph{et al.}  transform the original user-item heterogeneous graph into two semi homogeneous graphs from the perspective of users and items respectively.\n\\par Different from recommending items for users, intent recommendation is a new type of recommendation service in mobile e-commerce Apps, which aims to automatically recommend user intent according to user historical behaviors without any input. Fan~\\emph{et al.}~  propose to represent user intent as default queries in search box and transform the intent recommendation problem as recommending the queries. They construct a HG containing three types of nodes (Users, Items and Queries) and their mutual interactions, shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:intent}. Then, a meta-path-guided HGNN, called MEIRec, is designed to learn the nodes' embeddings of users and queries through aggregating the neighbors along the given meta-paths in an end-to-end manner.  \n\\par User profiling is playing an increasingly important role in providing personalized services in e-commerce platform. Different from previous methods only considering each user as an individual data instance, recent literature begins to model the abundant interaction information of users as a HG to enrich the characteristics of users. Chen \\emph{et al.}~  construct three kinds of objects (i.e., users, items and attributes) as a HG, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:profiling}, and propose a hierarchical heterogeneous GAT to predict the traits of users (e.g., gender and age) by aggregating each layer of objects' embeddings. Apart from trait prediction, Zheng \\emph{et al.}~  exploit HG to model the interactions between PID and MID with item ID in the e-commerce user alignment task. Then a Heterogeneous Embedding Propagation (HEP) model, encoding the interaction and edge features into node embeddings, is proposed to predict whether PID and MID across different devices refer to the same person.\n\\par With the development of e-commerce, there are many fraudsters in e-commerce system, who profit from transactions by illegal means. Due to the heterogeneity of fraudsters behavior patterns, some works try to detect these malicious accounts through HG embedding methods. Liu~\\emph{et al.}~  consider behaviours of fraudsters as ``Device aggregation\" and ``Activity aggregation\" in the view of HG, and they propose a GNN, called GEM, which simultaneously models the topology of the heterogeneous account-device graph and the characteristics of accounts activities in the local structure. Moreover, to enrich the embeddings of users, Hu~\\emph{et al.}~  treat the users, merchants, devices in credit payment service as different types of nodes and their interactions as edges in a HG, and propose a meta-path-based heterogeneous graph embedding method, called HACUD, to classify the cash-out user.  Li~\\emph{et al.}~  treat the users and items as nodes in a bipartite graph and associate the reviews as edge features to detect the spam reviews on Xianyu App. Then, a heterogeneous GNN is proposed to classify whether a review is spam or not, based on its local heterogeneous information and global context.\n\\begin{figure*}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfigure[Malware detection .]{\n\t\\includegraphics[height=1in,width=0.22\\linewidth]{HINDorid.png}\n\t\\label{fig:HinDroid}\n\t}\n\t\\hspace{7mm}\n\t\\subfigure[Key player identification~ .]{\n\t\\includegraphics[height=1in,width=0.28\\linewidth]{AHIN.JPG}\n\t\\label{fig:AHIN security}\n\t}\n\t\\hspace{7mm}\n\t\\subfigure[Drug trafficker identification .]{\n\t\t\\includegraphics[height=1in,width=0.35\\linewidth]{ahin.png}\n\t\t\\label{fig:ahin}\n\t}\n\t\\caption{The representative HGs in cybersecurity applications.}\n\t\\label{fig:security}\n\\end{figure*}", "cites": [1417, 1437, 1429, 1420], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3076923076923077, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of HG embedding applications in e-commerce by introducing various tasks and methods, such as IntentGC, GATNE, and HACUD.

As multiple heterogeneous entities and complex structure are usually involved in security system, recently researchers pay more attention to use HG embedding methods to detect outliers in a wide range of security areas, such as malware detection, key player identification in underground forum, drug trafficker identification.\n\\par With the broad scale proliferation of increasingly interconnected devices, malware (e.g., trojans, ransomware, scamware) that deliberately fulfills the harmful intent to device users has become a major threat to compromise the security in cyberspace . In particular, the explosive growth and increasing sophistication of Android malware call for new defensive techniques that are capable of protecting mobile users against novel threats .\nTo combat the evolving Android malware attacks, HG-based methods have been proposed and applied in anti-malware industry. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:HinDroid}, HinDroid  was first proposed to construct a HG to model the complex relations among application programming interface (APIs) and Android applications (apps), based on which meta-paths are used to formulate the relatedness among apps and multi-kernel learning algorithm is proposed to build the classification model for malware detection. Besides modeling apps and APIs, Fan~\\emph{et al.}~  model more types of entities involved in malware into a HG, such as, file, archive and machine, and a metagraph based embedding method is designed to encode high-level semantic similarities between files. After these methods, a series of HG embedding methods are proposed for dynamic malware detection~ , adversarial attack and defense in malware~ , unknown malware detection~  and cyber threat intelligence~ .\n\\par Besides android malware detection, HG embedding methods also play an important role in detecting targeted objects in other security areas which have multiple types of entities and relations available. Zhang~\\emph{et al.}  extract multiple relations from the underground forum data and construct an attributed HG (AHG) for key player identification, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:AHIN security}. By treating the relatedness over users depicted by each meta-path as one view, a multi-view GCN is proposed to identify the key player. As illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ahin}, Zhang~\\emph{et al.}  leverage AHG to depict vendors, drugs, texts, photos and their associated attributes in darknet markets for drug trafficker identification. Then an attribute-aware AHG embedding method, named \\textit{Vendor2Vec}, consisting of attribute-aware meta-path random walk and skip-gram technique, is proposed to predict whether a given pair of vendors are the same individual or not. \n\\begin{table*}[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{A summary of commonly used HG datasets.}\n  \\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n    \\hline\n    \\multirow{2}{*}{Dataset} & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{Statistics} & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{Side information} & \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{Task}     & \\multirow{2}{*}{Related Papers} \\\\\n\t\\cline{2-10}          & Node & Link & Meta-path & Timestamp & Attribute & Node classification & Multi classification & Recommendation & Link prediction &  \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\hline\n    DBLP\t& \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} Author(A)\\\\Paper(P)\\\\Term(T)\\\\Venue(V) \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} A-P\\\\P-P\\\\P-T\\\\P-V \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\APA\\\\APAPA\\\\APCPA\\\\APTPA\\\\APVPA\\\\ \\end{tabular} & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & & $\\surd$ & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\  \\\\  \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Aminer\t& \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} Paper(P)\\\\Author(A)\\\\Keyword(W)\\\\Venue(V)\\\\Conference(C)\\\\Term(T) \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} P-A\\\\P-P\\\\P-V\\\\P-W\\\\P-T\\\\P-C \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\APA\\\\WPW\\\\APVPA\\\\APTPA\\\\APCPA\\\\APWPA\\\\ \\\\ \\end{tabular} & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & & $\\surd$ & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\  \\\\  \\end{tabular} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Yelp\t& \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} User(U)\\\\Business(B)\\\\Compliment(Co)\\\\City(Ci)\\\\Category(Ca) \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} U-U\\\\U-B\\\\U-Co\\\\B-Ci\\\\B-Ca\\\\ \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\UBU\\\\UCoU\\\\UBCiBU\\\\UBCaBU\\\\BUB\\\\BCiB\\\\BCaB\\\\BUCoUB\\\\ \\\\\\end{tabular} & $\\surd$ &       & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}  \\\\  \\end{tabular} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Amazon\t& \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} User(U)\\\\Business(Bu)\\\\Category(C)\\\\Brand(Br)\\\\Aspect(A) \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\U-Bu\\\\Bu-C\\\\Bu-Br\\\\R-Bu\\\\R-A\\\\ \\\\ \\end{tabular} & N/A &\t\t&  $\\surd$  &       &       & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}  \\end{tabular} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    IMDB\t& \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} User(U)\\\\Movie(M)\\\\Actor(A)\\\\Director(D)\\\\Genre(G) \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} A-M\\\\U-M\\\\G-M\\\\D-M \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\MUM\\\\MAM\\\\MDM\\\\MGM\\\\UMU\\\\UMAMU\\\\UMDMU\\\\UMGMU\\\\ \\\\ \\end{tabular} & & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}  \\end{tabular} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Douban\t& \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} User(U)\\\\Movie(M)\\\\Group(G)\\\\Location(L)\\\\Direction(D)\\\\Actor(A)\\\\Type(T) \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} U-U\\\\U-G\\\\U-M\\\\U-L\\\\M-D\\\\M-T\\\\M-A \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}} \\\\MUM\\\\MTM\\\\MDM\\\\MAM\\\\UMU\\\\UMAMU\\\\UMDMU\\\\UMTMU\\\\ \\\\ \\end{tabular} & & & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & $\\surd$ & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}  \\end{tabular} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}}\n  \\label{datasets}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [1417, 1426, 1438, 248, 1419, 1433, 1423, 1425, 1427, 1424, 1429, 1430], "cite_extract_rate": 0.36363636363636365, "origin_cites_number": 33, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 1.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of HG embedding applications in cybersecurity, mentioning specific methods and their uses (e.g., HinDroid, Vendor2Vec), but lacks synthesis of the underlying principles or connections between them.

Therefore, exploring self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graph embedding is expected to further facilitate the development of this area.\nAnother important direction is the pre-training of HGNNs . Nowadays, HGNNs are designed independently, i.e., the proposed method usually works well for some certain tasks, but the transfer ability across different tasks is ill-considered. When dealing with a new HG or task, we have to train a heterogeneous graph embedding method from scratch, which is time-consuming and requires large amounts of labels. In this situation, if there is a well pre-trained HGNN with strong generalization that can be fine-tuned with few labels, the time and label consumption can be reduced.", "cites": [240, 221, 9141, 248, 1184, 1429, 7357, 180, 1430, 1439, 1440], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7857142857142857, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section analytically explores the challenges and future directions of HGNNs by referencing relevant work on self-supervised learning and pre-training, integrating concepts from multiple papers.

The abstraction is moderate, as it identifies general trends but does not elevate them to meta-level principles."}}

Considering that most methods are black boxes, making HG embedding reliable is an important future work.\n\\textbf{Fair HG embedding.} The embeddings learned by methods are sometimes highly related to certain attributes, e.g., age or gender, which may amplify the societal stereotypes in the prediction results . Therefore, learning fair or de-biased embeddings is an important research direction. There are some researches on the fairness of homogeneous graph embedding . However, the fairness of HG is still an unsolved problem, which is an important research direction in the further.\n\\textbf{Robust HG embedding.} Also, the robustness of  HG embedding, especially the adversarial attacking, is always an important problem . Since many real world applications are built based on HG, the robustness of HG embedding becomes an urgent yet unsolved problem. What is the weakness of HG embedding and how to enhance it to improve the robustness need to be further studied.\n\\textbf{Explainable HG embedding.} Moreover, in some risk aware scenarios, e.g., fraud detection  and bio-medicine  , the explanation of models or embeddings is important. A significant advantage of HG is that it contains rich semantics, which may provide eminent insight to promote the explanation of heterogeneous GNNs.

Exploring more capacity of heterogeneous graph embedding on other areas holds great potential in the future.

Therefore, heterogeneous graph embedding is expected to open up broad prospects for these new areas and become promising analytical tool. Another area is the biological systems, which can also be naturally modeled as a HG. A typical biological system contains many types of objects, e.g., Gene Expression, Chemical, Phenotype, and Microbe. There are also multiple relations between Gene Expression and Phenotype . HG structure has been applied to biological system as an analytical tool, implying that heterogeneous graph embedding is expected to provide more promising results. \nIn addition, since the complexity of HGNNs are relatively large and the techniques are difficult to parallelize, it is difficult to apply the existing HGNNs to large-scale industrial scenarios.

Some attempts have been made towards hyperbolic graph/heterogeneous graph embedding, and the results are rather promising . However, how to design an effective hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs is still challenging, which can be another research direction. \n\\textbf{Heterogeneous graph structure learning.} Under the current heterogeneous graph embedding framework, HG is usually constructed beforehand, which is independent on the heterogeneous graph embedding. This may result in that the input HG is not suitable for the final task. HG structure learning can be further integrated with heterogeneous graph embedding, so that they can promote each other. \n\\textbf{Connections with knowledge graph.} Knowledge graph embedding has great potential on knowledge reasoning . However, knowledge graph embedding and heterogeneous graph embedding are usually investigated separately. Recently, knowledge graph embedding has been successfully applied to other areas, e.g., recommender system .
