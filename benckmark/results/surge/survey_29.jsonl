The blockchain itself is a database that keeps track of all transactions occurred in the network and is replicated at every participating node. It essentially realizes a distributed ledger without relying on a central authority to bootstrap the trust among participants or to clear the transactions. It also does not assume trust among the participating nodes. Blockchain is meant to enable trusted computation among a group of mutually distrustful participants. On the other hand, blockchain is also known for providing trustworthy immutable record keeping service. The block data structure adopted in a blockchain embeds the hash of the previous block in the next block generated. The use of hash chain ensures that data written on the blockchain can not be modified. In addition, a public blockchain system supports third-party auditing and some blockchain systems support a high level of anonymity, that is, a user can transact online using a pseudonym without revealing his/her true identity. \nThe security properties promised by blockchain is unprecedented and truly inspiring. Pioneering blockchain systems such as Bitcoin have greatly impacted the digital payment world. It is envisioned that blockchain technology and applications built on top of it will revolutionize a broad array of financial service industries as well as non-financial sectors. \nAmong the many technical components that a blockchain system is composed of, the distributed consensus protocol is the key technology that enables blockchain's decentralization, or more specifically, that ensures all participants agree on a unified transaction ledger without the help of a central authority. The distributed consensus protocol specifies message passing and local decision making at each node. Various design choices in the consensus protocol can greatly impact a blockchain system's performance, including its transaction capacity, scalablity, and fault tolerance. \nThe Nakamoto consensus protocol  is the protocol implemented in the Bitcoin network. With the help of this consensus protocol, Bitcoin became the first digital currency system to resist double-spending attacks in a decentralized peer-to-peer network of little trust.\nAs the Bitcoin network continues to grow, Nakamoto consensus has encountered several performance bottlenecks and sustainability problems. Researchers in blockchain communities have raised the following concerns on Nakamoto consensus and particularly its proof-of-work (PoW) mining mechanism: 1) unsustainable energy consumption, 2) low transaction capacity and poor scalability, 3) long-term security concerns as mining rewards diminish. For instance, the Bitcoin network currently consists of roughly ten thousand nodes , while the maximum transaction capacity of Bitcoin is 7 transactions per second (TPS) and can be increased to at most 25 TPS by tuning protocol parameters without jeopardizing consensus safety . In contrast, the VISA network consists of 50 million participants and can handle up to 65,000 TPS . A single Bitcoin transaction (November 2019) consumes the equivalent amount of electricity that would power 21 average U.S. households for one day . \nIn response to the above performance limitations of PoW mining, blockchain researchers have been investigating new block proposing mechanisms such as proof of stake (PoS), proof of authority (PoA), and proof of elapsed time (PoET) which do not require computation-intensive mining, thus effectively reducing energy consumption. In some cases, cryptographic methods can be used to establish trust among nodes, enabling the use of more coordinated block proposing schemes such as round-robin and committee-based block generation. Appropriate incentives that will continue to encourage honest participation in the blockchain network is another key component of consensus protocol. Therefore, alternative block proposing schemes are often accompanied by a new incentive mechanism that promotes participation fairness and increases overall system sustainability. Popular blockchain consensus protocols encompassing these ideas include Peercoin , Bitcoin-NG , Ourosboros (Cardano) , Snow White , and EOSIO , POA Network , etc.\nBesides block proposing and incentive mechanisms, researchers have been seeking solutions from the prior wisdom---primarily {\\color{\\rcolor}classical Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus and secure multi-party computation (MPC)}---for efficient block finalization methods. For example, the state machine replication (SMR) based BFT consensus algorithms have great potential in permissioned blockchain networks operated with static and revealed identities, of which Tendermint , Algorand , Casper FFG , and Hyperledger Fabric  are well-known use cases. Moreover, asynchronous consensus protocols such as HoneyBadgerBFT  and BEAT  were proposed to provide robust block finalization under severe network conditions with uncertain message delays.\n\\textbf{Our contribution} \nWith more blockchain consensus mechanisms being proposed, there is a pressing need to analyze and compare them in a formal and cohesive manner.\nIn this survey we present a comprehensive review and analysis of the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols and their development history, \nwith a special focus on their performance, fault tolerance, and security implications.

PoW-based protocols scale well with network size and are suited for permissionless blockchains, but yield very limited throughput and long confirmation latency. This is due to the security implication of their lack of consensus finality and limited capacity of raising block frequency and block size. In comparison, BFT protocols have built-in consensus finality and achieve much higher transaction capacity, but incur high messaging complexity per block ($O(N^2)$ versus PoW's $O(N)$, $N$ is network size) and need a permissioned network for identity management. As a result they do not scale well with network size. Besides remarking their differences, this paper also explores how the hybrid use of BFT and PoW can enhance the performance of established blockchain systems and provides tentative solutions to improve blockchain scalability.\nCachin et al.  gives an overview of thirteen prominent consensus protocols designed for permissioned blockchain platforms along with their fault tolerance and security properties. The authors also make a powerful statement that the design of blockchain consensus protocols should follow the rigor established in prevailing wisdom of cryptography, security, and distributed systems, rather than in an ad hoc manner. This is particularly true when the consensus protocol regulates significant financial values and societal trust.\nHowever, it does not provide a methodology to combine the prevailing wisdom in order to design a consensus protocol for specific needs.\nThe work by Bano et al.  is the first well-structured survey of blockchain consensus protocols. It identifies three classes of consensus protocols based on committee formation and block proposing rules: 1) PoW, 2) proof of X (PoX) alternatives to PoW, and 3) hybrid consensus protocols that take advantage of classical distributed consensus techniques. \nThis paper emphasizes the role of committee in hybrid consensus protocols. General discussions on the formation and configuration of committee and possible solutions to multi-committee (i.e. sharding-based) consensus are provided.\nThis paper also presents an evaluation framework that takes into account the protocol safety (censorship resistance, DoS resistance and fault tolerance) and performance (throughput and latency).\nNotably, this paper is the closest work to our survey in terms of classification of block proposing mechanisms. However, analysis of new protocols in the area of PoS requires new methods of analysis. \n{\\color{\\rcolor}\nWang et al.  provides a comprehensive survey of blockchain consensus protocols and an in-depth review of incentive mechanism designs. The paper starts with a layered view of the blockchain network including the consensus part followed by a general discussion on the compatibility between consensus protocol and incentive mechanism. Then detailed consensus schemes are introduced, including Nakamoto consensus, proof-of-concept consensus schemes, and virtual mining techniques such as proof of stake (PoS) along with the usability of trusted hardware. Hybridization between PoX and classical BFT protocols is also discussed. This survey also features a game-theoretical characterization of Nakamoto consensus' incentive mechanism and its influence on system fairness and decentralization. The efficiency-scalability trade-off is also explored.\nDespite of having rich details on consensus techniques and insights into blockchain protocol design, this survey does not provide a concise abstraction that captures different functional components of a consensus protocol or a cohesive characterization on fault-tolerant distributed consensus primitives that can be used for blockchain consensus. \n}\nXiao et al.  provides a succinct tutorial on distributed consensus protocols, from classical BFT protocols to the Nakamoto consensus protocol as well as recent breakthroughs in blockchain consensus. Specially this tutorial provides an abstraction of consensus goals for permissionless blockchains following the paradigm of classical BFT consensus. \n{\\color{\\rcolor}\nThe authors also remark that the network model and trust model should be jointly considered when designing blockchain consensus protocols for practical applications. However, this tutorial skips details on each consensus protocols and does not clarify how different components of a blockchain consensus protocol contribute to system performance and security.\n}\n{\\color{\\rcolor}\nBelotti et al.  provides a \\emph{vademecum} on blockchain technology including development history, transaction and ledger structure, blockchain system abstraction, consensus mechanisms, and a detailed guide on when and how to use which blockchain technology. The consensus mechanisms covered include PoW, PoS, BFT algorithms, and hybrid BFT-based algorithms. Notably, this paper also gives a quantitative comparison of consensus mechanisms with respect to fault tolerance, node scalability, throughput, and transaction latency. Though with great details on building and managing a blockchain system, this vademecum can be perfected with an abstraction for each type of consensus mechanisms and a high-level tutorial on how to reach a compromise between different desired features.\n}", "cites": [1295, 1294, 1296], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 4.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple surveys and tutorials, drawing connections between them to highlight common themes and limitations.

The network finalizes only one block out of multiple proposed blocks for each checkpoint.\n{\\color{\\rcolor}\nFor blockchain networks with a complex application layer such as smart contract, transaction execution often incurs significant computation. While in popular BFT-SMR schemes such as PBFT execution is integrated into the consensus process. An early work by Yin et al.  presents an alternative BFT-SMR framework that separates consensus (i.e. agreement on execution order) from execution, as the latter conveniently requires only an honest majority of execution nodes instead of an honest two-thirds of consensus nodes required by the former. This separation scheme is adopted by Zyzzyva  and Tendermint  wherein a small group of nodes are dedicated to the consensus task. Hyperledger Fabric  further separates the consensus task into ordering service and validation service for better modularity.\n}\nFrom the performance perspective, BFT protocols are notorious for their limited scalability in network size.\nEpitomized by PBFT, the message complexity of partially synchronous BFT protocols grows quadratically with the network size $N$. This means that given a fixed network bandwidth at each node, a growing network size leads to exploding communication overhead and diminishing transaction capacity. \nAccording to the performance evaluation in , PBFT achieves a maximum throughput of 16,000 TPS when $N=8$; this figure drops to around 3,000 when $N=64$. \nOn the other hand, for asynchronous protocols like HoneyBadgerBFT where erasure coding and threshold encryption are used to reduce communication complexity and enhance security, the extensive use of cryptography also brings non-negligible computation overhead, adding to local processing delays.\nOn the bright side, a typical BFT protocol achieves \\emph{deterministic finality}, which is also known as \\emph{forward security}  in that a settled transaction will never be altered. As we will discuss in Section \\ref{sec:nakamoto}, this allows BFT protocols to take advantage of shorter block intervals and attain high transaction throughput. \nOther blockchain compatibility challenges for BFT-SMR protocols include: 1) allowing nodes to join and leave flexibly without interrupting consensus while countering Sybil attacks; 2) adapting to real-world peer-to-peer networks that are sparsely connected. In later sections we will revisit these issues for blockchain protocols that incorporate BFT consensus.", "cites": [1292, 1297, 1293], "cite_extract_rate": 0.42857142857142855, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes key adaptations and design choices of BFT-SMR protocols in the context of blockchain, using multiple cited works to build a coherent narrative.

Meanwhile, the limited size of a permissioned blockchain's consensus body} \n    allows for the deployment of more efficient consensus protocols that achieve higher transaction capacity .\n\\end{itemize}\nTable \\ref{tab:permissionless-v-permissioned} summarizes the major differences between permissionless and permissioned blockchain in nine aspects.\nBeneath the blockchain peer-to-peer network lies the basic infrastructure of the Internet. Thanks to the transport layer protocols (especially the retransmission mechanism), message delivery is considered guaranteed, while the message delay may vary but most likely will not grow longer as time elapses (weak synchrony) or remains within a certain bound ($\\Delta$-synchrony). Therefore we often consider a practical blockchain network partially synchronous, just like most distributed networks overlaying on the Internet. This allows the consensus protocol to take advantage of the timing services of the Internet. For example, in Bitcoin the partial synchrony assumption is echoed by its usage of local timestamps for loose chronological ordering, showing time consciousness. For the blockchain networks that reside on an ad hoc infrastructure not based on the Internet, the message transmission is subject to unexpected network delays, which gives rise to asynchronous consensus protocols such as HoneyBadgerBFT, as we discussed in Section \\ref{sec:background}.\n\\textbf{Transaction~}\nA blockchain transaction can be regarded as a public static data record showing the token value redistribution between sender and receiver . Take Bitcoin as an example, a transaction transfers token ownership from the sender account to the receiver account(s). It specifies a list of inputs and a list of outputs, with each input claiming a previous unspent transaction output (UXTO) that belongs to the sender, who needs to attach its signature to the inputs to justify the claim. Each output specifies how many tokens go to which receiver and the total token value of the outputs is equal to the UXTOs claimed by the inputs. Therefore, we can always recover the ownership records of any specific token by tracing back the signatures along the chain of transactions. The token balance of an account equals to the summed UXTOs that belong to the account. \n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{figures/blockchain-ds.png}\n    \\caption{Blockchain data structure.

It is also the consensus target of the network. The basic structure of blockchain is illustrated in Fig. \\ref{fig:blockchain-ds}. Every block encloses a set of transactions that should be valid and clear of double spending.\nAs was pioneered by Bitcoin, the transactions are often organized in a Merkle tree. Merkle tree is a data structure widely used for data storage and efficient data integrity check . In blockchain, every block contains one Merkle tree in which each leaf node is labeled with a transaction hash. The Merkle tree root serves as a digest of the transaction set and is placed in the block header.\nThe block header also contains a hash of the previous block (except in the genesis block) and other configuration information, which typically includes a timestamp and the blockchain state at block generation.\n{\\color{\\rcolor}The growing chain of blocks and the aforementioned transaction format essentially constitute the blockchain data structure used for the storage, serialization, and validation of new transactions which are continuously injected into the network.}\nAside from recording the transaction history, the blockchain can also record auxiliary information used for other purposes. \n{\\color{\\rcolor}\nThe locking and unlocking scripts associated with transaction inputs and outputs can be repurposed for constructing off-chain payment channel (eg. Lightning Network ) and global state machine that helps build smart contracts, which are the basis of many important applications such as supply chain management and decentralized autonomous organization.\n}\nThe block header may also contain extra fields that facilitate system coordination. For example, Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) scheme Casper FFG  utilizes smart contract to implement the staking process; Algorand  attaches a cryptographic proof to each new block to show the block proposer's eligibility to propose. As a result, the blockchain can hold the necessary control information usable by the consensus protocol.

This strategy is known as \\textit{selfish mining}. \nIt is shown by Eyal et al.  that a selfish mining group can generate a disproportionately higher revenue than that from honest mining if the group's mining power surpasses a certain threshold $\\theta$, assuming the group has a certain communication capability measured by $\\gamma\\in[0,1]$, which is the fraction of honest nodes that will follow the malicious chain in case of forks. \nAs a result, the selfish mining group can attract new miners and eventually outgrow the honest miners.

First, miners in established public blockchain networks actually care about the system's longevity and reputation, which can positively affect the exchange rate of the cryptocurrency and thus their mining revenue.

A variant of Bitcoin-NG called Waves-NG  is currently used in Wave Platform, a blockchain initiative. The key insight of Bitcoin-NG is decoupling block generation into two planes: \\emph{leader-election} and \\emph{transaction serialization}, which respectively correspond to two types of blocks: \\emph{key blocks} and \\emph{micro blocks}. The key blocks resemble Bitcoin's blocks, which contain a solution to a hash puzzle representing the proof of work and have an average block interval of 10 minutes, except for the actual transactions which are included in the micro blocks. Once a key block is mined, all subsequent micro blocks shall be generated by the current key block miner until the generation of the next key block. The generation of micro blocks is deterministic and does not contain proof of work. As a result, the micro block frequency is in the control of the key block miner (up to a maximum) to accommodate as many transactions as possible. The blockchain data structure of Bitcoin-NG is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:bitcoin-ng-dr}. \nThe longest-chain rule is still applied to finalize and resolve forks of key blocks. As for the micro blocks, since they are batch-generated by key block miners, Bitcoin-NG relies on a combination of a heaviest-chain extension rule and a longest-chain extension rule to finalize and resolve forks of micro blocks.\nTo encourage honest participation and discourage the current key block miner from double-spending and other malfeasance, 60\\% of the transaction fees collected from micro blocks by the current key block miner are redistributed to the miner of the next key block. \n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{figures/bitcoin-ng-dr.png}\n    \\caption{Bitcoin-NG blockchain data structure.

Each cycle involves a multi-round BFT consensus process to finalize one block. Each round consists of three phases: Propose, Prevote, Precommit. Specially, in the Propose phase a validator is designated by a deterministic algorithm as the block proposer in a round-robin fashion such that validators are chosen with frequency proportional to the value of their deposited stakes. A validator continues iterating the three-phase rounds until one block receives more than 2/3 of Precommits.

Casper FFG slightly deviates from Algorithm \\ref{algo:bftbased-pos0} for that it directly incorporates PoS into block finalization.\nAlgorithm \\ref{algo:bftbased-pos} shows the general procedure of Casper FFG for each validator. Newly generated and received blocks are attached to the \\emph{BlockTree}, which is similar to the tree data structure used by the GHOST rule. The actual consensus subject, however, is the \\emph{CheckPointTree}, which is a subtree of \\emph{BlockTree}.\nSpecifically, for every consensus epoch (100 in \\emph{BlockTree}'s height or 1 in \\emph{CheckPointTree}'s height), every validator broadcasts to peers a vote for a block as the checkpoint. The height of the block in \\emph{BlockTree} must be divisible by 100. The vote consists of a \\emph{justified} source checkpoint $CP_s$ and its height $h(s)$, a target checkpoint $CP_t$ and its height $h(t)$ ($h(s)<h(t)$), and the validator's signature $S$. All votes are broadcast to the network and are weighted by the signer's stake value. If the source-target checkpoint pair $\\langle CP_s, CP_t \\rangle$ is voted by validators who possess more than 2/3 of total deposited stakes, then $CP_t$ is justified and $CP_s$ is \\emph{finalized}. All blocks between $CP_s$ and $CP_t$ are finalized as well. Casper FFG relies on two so called \\emph{Casper Commandments} for ensuring consensus safety: 1) validator must not cast two distinct votes for the same checkpoint height, and 2) validator must not cast a new vote whose source-target span is within that of its existing vote. Violators are subject to slashing rules including forfeiting stakes and temporarily banning from staking. Since every vote is signed with the validator's private key and received by peer validators, Casper FFG can conveniently detect violators and enforce the slashing rules. \nThe current smart contract implementation of Casper FFG is documented in EIP 1011 . A stakeholder becomes a participating validator by depositing a stake in the dedicated smart contract, which encodes Casper FFG and can be accessed via Ethereum transactions.\nNotably, Casper FFG is the preamble project of Casper Correct-by-Construction (Casper CBC), the PoS protocol family that will be used by Ethereum 2.0 to complete the transition to pure PoS . \nTo further improve performance and scalability, Ethereum 2.0 also plans to combine PoS with sharding . In a nutshell, all Ethereum 2.0 participants are divided into shards. Each shard runs a blockchain instance via a consensus scheme not limiting to PoS. On the top level, the main chain, known as the ``beacon chain'', will be maintained by a group of known validators via a Casper CBC protocol. Each validator is randomly assigned to a shard as the shard manager and periodically commits a digest of the shard chain to the main chain. The parallelism of sharding and the energy efficiency of PoS can theoretically scale up both transaction throughput and network size. Nonetheless, the sharding scheme is still an ongoing work and faces several challenges before being harmonized with Casper CBC. They include the increased take-over risk related to small shard size, the difficulty in coordinating inter-shard communication and token transfer.\n\\textbf{Security analysis} BFT-based PoS's consensus fault tolerance varies among the three above-mentioned implementations. In Tendermint, although block proposers are determined based on PoS, all validators have the equal weight in the consensus process. Therefore Tendermint tolerates up to 1/3 of Byzantine validators. In comparison, Algorand and Casper FFG tolerate up to 1/3 of maliciously-possessed stakes. In Algorand, if an attacker owns more than 1/3 of total tokens, then chance is high that more than 1/3 of the elected committee members is compromised by the attacker, leading to consensus failure of $BA\\star$. In Casper FFG, if an attacker owns more than 1/3 of total deposited stakes and dominates the communication within the network, the compromised validators can vote on conflicting checkpoints without getting punished.

Instead of undergoing the hashing-intensive mining, PoET simulates the time that would be consumed by PoW mining. That is, every node randomly backs off for an exponentially distributed period of time before announcing its block. To ensure that the local time truly elapses, PoET requires the back-off mechanism to be carried out in a trusted execution environment (TEE), which is an isolated memory area that provides integrity and confidentiality to the program running inside, against a compromised hosting platform. Specially, the program enclosed in a TEE is called an ``enclave\". Intel SGX  and Arm TrustZone  are the two major TEE solutions. Among other utilities, TEE provides an integrity proof of enclave program through remote attestation, which essentially helps the network establish trust on consensus participants. \nTaking Hyperledger Sawtooth for example, the PoET protocol works in two phases for every participating node $i$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textit{TEE setup}: Node $i$ first obtains the PoET protocol program from a trusted source and instantiates the program on its SGX machine wherein the random back-off routine runs inside an enclave. The trusted program generates a signing key pair $\\langle PK_i,SK_i \\rangle$ for node $i$ and starts the attestation process which results in sending an attestation report to the network. The attestation report contains the public key $PK_i$ and the enclave measurement signed by the Intel Enhanced Privacy Identification (EPID) private key inside the enclave. Other nodes in the network will validate the node $i$'s hardware authenticity through Intel Attestation Service (IAS) and validate the attestation report before accepting node $i$.\n    \\item \\textit{Participating in consensus}: The consensus process is similar to Nakamoto except for block generation and validation. For each block cycle, node $i$ waits for a period dictated by the random back-off routine running in the enclave before producing a new block. The enclave then generates a certificate of back-off completion signed by node $i$'s private key $SK_i$ which is broadcast to the network along with the new block. Upon receipt of the new block, other nodes validate the block content and the back-off completion certificate with node $i$'s public key $PK_i$. A block shall be appended to the blockchain if it passes validation and the finalization rule.\n\\end{enumerate}\nWhile PoET was initially proposed to substitute the PoW for block proposal without touching on the longest-chain rule, the usage of hardware-assisted public key cryptography actually enables the use of more efficient BFT algorithms for block finalization. The hybrid PoET-BFT idea is currently used by Sawtooth PBFT , a sub-project of Hyperledger Sawtooth.\n\\textbf{Security analysis~} PoET can tolerate up to 50\\% TEE nodes being malicious. Since every TEE node runs the same random back-off routine in its enclave, a player can shorten its expected back-off time by running multiple TEE nodes, which is susceptible to Sybil attacks. If more than 50\\% of TEE devices collude or are controlled by an attacker, they can ultimately win the block race and keep extending the malicious chain. Therefore, PoET is most suited for permissioned blockchains, where every participant is authenticated and runs one TEE node.\nFor Hyperledger Sawtooth, Intel is the sole TEE hardware vendor and attestation service provider, which poses a single point of risk to the network. The validity of remote attestation depends on the integrity of SGX implementation and the availability of IAS.

Unlike public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Ripple treats individual transactions as the ledger's atomic items, similar to a transaction log.\nIn Ripple network, only validator nodes can participate in consensus. We call a validator node ``node'' for simplicity. Nodes collect transactions from clients and propose them to peer nodes for consensus. In initialization, every node establishes a unique node list (UNL) which identifies the nodes it can trust and directly exchange messages with. A UNL relationship is reciprocal. We call a group of nodes that are fully connected by UNL relationships a UNL clique. \n\\begin{algorithm}[!h]\n\\label{algo:ripple}\n\\caption{RPCA (validator node)}\n\\setcounter{AlgoLine}{0}\nJoining Ripple network as a validator;\\\n\\tcc{Main loop}\n\\For{new epoch}{\nCollect valid transactions (new or leftover from previous epochs) $\\Rightarrow$ $CandidateSet$;\\\n\\For{$r=1\\to MaxRound$}{\nBroadcast $CandidateSet$ to UNL peers;\nAfter receiving transactions from UNL peers, add them to $CandidateSet$ and broadcast a vote on the veracity (yes/no) of every transaction;\nAfter receiving votes from UNL peers, discard transactions from $CandidateSet$ whose yes-votes fall short of a threshold $TH_r$ ($TH_{MaxRound}=80\\%$);\n}\nThe remaining transactions in $CandidateSet$ are accepted into the ledger; \n}\n\\end{algorithm}\nThe operation of RCPA at one node is shown in Algorithm \\ref{algo:ripple}. RCPA runs in epochs, each of which finalizes a certain set of transactions into the ledger. Every epoch involves multiple rounds\nof transaction filtering. The ledger is marked ``closed'' after the final round. Specially, the yes-vote threshold of the final round $TH_{MaxRound}=80\\%$, which is designed to cope with the network connectivity assumption that any two UNL cliques $UNL_i,UNL_j$ must be at least 20\\% overlapped, i.e. sharing at least $\\frac{1}{5}\\max(|UNL_i|,|UNL_j|)$ inter-clique UNL relationships. \nIn an ideal environment, as long as $MaxRound$ is large enough, all valid transactions proposed by non-faulty nodes should eventually surpass the 80\\% yes-vote threshold.\n\\textbf{Security analysis~} RCPA imitates a relaxed DLS protocol with an artificial BFT bound of 1/5. It further requires no more than 1/5 of nodes are faulty in every UNL clique in order to ensure overall network consensus. \nCompared to PBFT that achieves 1/3 Byzantine fault tolerance with $O(N^2)$ message complexity in a fully connected network, RPCA's 1/5 fault tolerance bound trades for a lower connectivity requirement and thus lower message complexity per block cycle, which is $O(MK^2)=O(NK)$ where $K$ is the clique size and $M=N/K$ is the number of cliques. Therefore Ripple {demonstrates the possibility of} trading fault tolerance for better performance when a certain level of trust is assumed. \nOn the down side, RCPA's multi-round broadcast scheme among a UNL clique and the quick convergence of votes require high synchrony among clique members. This impairs Ripple's decentralization capability in practical settings.\nRipple's current customers are primarily established corporations and financial institutions. Possible reasons include the above-mentioned synchrony requirement and that the 1/5 fault tolerance can be too restrictive for low-trust environments.

One notable weakness of SPECTRE is that the pairwise ordering of blocks may not extend to a fully linear ordering. This leads to SPECTRE's weak liveness (i.e. only supports naturally chronological transactions) and an increased risk of balancing attacks in that conflicts may not be solved. In contrast, PHANTOM realizes fully linear ordering of transactions and blocks in the DAG via the following algorithm. Every node searches the blockDAG for the largest $k$-cluster of blocks. $k$ denotes the node degree in the cluster, and is a predefined security parameter that rarely $k$ or more honest blocks are created simultaneously. The $k$-cluster is regarded as honest and all blocks within are linearly ordered. The transactions covered by the cluster are then validated in the new order. \nNotably, the largest $0$-cluster case is equivalent to the longest-chain rule of Nakamoto consensus. The authors also argues that PHANTOM can be utilized alongside SPECTRE for more flexible consensus performance, as the two ordering schemes are complimentary to each other. \n\\textbf{Security analysis~} Though with an innovative blockDAG ledger structure and a carefully designed ordering scheme for finality, SPECTRE and PHANTOM inherit other protocol components from Nakamoto's, including PoW-based block proposal, gossip-based information propagation, validity check on PoW and transactions. Therefore, the two blockDAG based schemes can tolerate up to 50\\% of maliciously controlled computing power. On the performance side, blockDAG-based schemes can theoretically support arbitrary throughput capacity, only to be capped by network bandwidth and nodes' processing speed. On the downside, the increased parent-selection flexibility may expose more attack surfaces to adaptive attackers (such as the balancing attack against SPECTRE), which is still an ongoing research topic.\nAlternatively, BlockDAG can be designed to incorporate a specific blockchain as a main chain, reflecting a similar idea as the GHOST rule. Conflux, a recent blockDAG scheme proposed by Li et al. , resorts to the GHOST rule for the finalization of a pivot chain, which is used as the reference for partitioning the blockDAG into chronological order.

\\ref{tab:comparison-dag} compare the protocols that we have discussed so far from three aspects: five-component framework composition, fault tolerance, and transaction processing capability. The latter includes maximum throughput and transaction confirmation latency.\nFor some consensus protocols, not all the five components are specified in the white paper. Protocols designed for permissioned blockchains (eg. BFT-SMR, PoET, PoTS) do not need to specify incentive mechanism; protocols that were initially proposed to substitute PoW (eg. PoA, PoET, PoR) inherit other components from Nakamoto's protocol by default.\nThe fault tolerance capability of a consensus protocol largely depends on the block finalization mechanism. For example, the 50\\% bound (of computing power or stake value) applies to all protocols that inherit the probabilistic finality property from Bitcoin; protocols with BFT-style block finalization typically achieve 33\\% fault tolerance and guarantee deterministic finality. {\\color{\\rcolor}In hybrid schemes, the 33\\% fault tolerance is usually coupled with the block proposal mechanism or a preexisting identity scheme. In Hybrid PoW-BFT and BFT-based PoS, each node's voting weight in the BFT consensus stage is augmented by its block proposing capability. This is achieved by either linking a player's opportunity of participation in BFT consensus to the PoX process (eg. Hybrid PoW-BFT, Tendermint), or directly weighting a player's vote in the BFT consensus by the player's stake value (eg. Algorand, Casper FFG). In other hybrid schemes such as PoA-BFT and PoET-BFT, the PoX process is purposed for identity management and thus the fault tolerance threshold is 33\\% of identities. DAG-based protocols generally achieves probabilistic finality (except Byteball) and 50\\% fault tolerance of either computing power, consensus participants, or token wealth.\n}\n{\\color{\\rcolor}\nThe statistics on transaction processing capability were fetched from either the simulation result in protocol white paper or documented experiment. The throughput metric measures the maximum TPS a protocol can handle, and is only precise to the scale of magnitude, i.e. sub-ten, tens, hundreds, or thousands. The confirmation latency metric estimates time for a submitted transaction to be finalized in the blockchain. We observe that protocols with probabilistic finality tend to have higher confirmation latency (typically more than 1 minute), and high throughput is often accompanied by low conformation latency.\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{figures/quantitative-compare.png}\n    \\caption{Comparing different blockchain consensus protocols on transaction throughput and scalability in network size. Note that for comparison purposes, we consider DAG-based schemes as wide-sense blockchain protocols.}\n    \\label{fig:quant-compare}\n\\end{figure}\nWe are also interested in another performance metric---scalability in network size, which measures how well a consensus protocol can maintain its transaction capacity when network size grows. \nGiven the difficulty of performing large-scale experiments on actual blockchain networks, the scalability results are either fetched from the simulation study in protocol white paper or based on our speculation on the current network status. It is worth noting that transaction throughput and scalability in network size are often recognized as two integral parts in scalability evaluation of a blockchain system .\nFig. \\ref{fig:quant-compare} illustrates performance of consensus protocols with respect to transaction throughput and scalability in network size along with suitability for permissioned or permissionless blockchains. \nFor protocols with BFT-style block finalization mechanism to achieve thousands of TPS, the network size should be small, typically around several hundred. Meanwhile, protocols that work for large-scale public networks are predominantly permissionless and employ a block finalization mechanism that only achieves probabilistic finality. Their transaction throughput is usually capped by a hundred TPS for security reasons. Generally, protocols illustrated farther to the top right in Fig. \\ref{fig:quant-compare} tend to achieve better overall performance and scalability. However the security implication of such superiority, exemplified by Bitcoin-NG and DAG-based protocols, is subject to constant scepticism and attracts ongoing research effort.\nAs for the suitability for permissioned or permissionless blockchains, we stress that protocols that need a stable consensus group with participation control and identification are suitable for permissioned blockchains. These protocols include PBFT, HoneyBadgerBFT, PoET-BFT, PoA-BFT, and RPCA. In comparison, protocols including Nakamoto, Nakamoto-GHOST, chain-based PoS, Bitcoin-NG, Algorand, and Tangle are specifically designed for large-scale permissionless blockchains. Meanwhile DPoS, Tendermint, hybrid PoW-BFT, committee-based PoS are designed for permissionless scenarios but rely on an election mechanism for maintaining a stable consensus group, of which the identities may be revealed for public supervision. DAG-based protocols are designed with the aim of scaling up in participant count and thus suited for permissionless networks.\n}\n{\\color{\\rcolor}", "cites": [1308], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "comparative", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a comparative overview of various blockchain consensus protocols by organizing them into a five-component framework, synthesizing information from multiple realizations.

Anticipating that the increasing number of participants would lead to more block contentions and blockchain forks in Bitcoin, Nakamoto designated the longest-chain rule for block finalization and cautiously fixed the average block interval to ten minutes for consensus security . Litecoin  and Ethereum  adopted shorter block intervals for faster transaction settlement. Observing the energy inefficiency of Bitcoin and the financial value of unused tokens, Peercoin pioneered the PoS mechanism which could substitute PoW with far less energy consumption . Yet its stake valuation scheme seemed to be heuristically designed. These early-day initiatives also commonly lacked sufficient security analysis, which were often scrutinized by researchers and practitioners .\nLater blockchain consensus protocols, especially those proposed after 2016, have started to take inspirations from the established research of distributed computing, cryptography, and trusted computing. For example, HoneyBadgerBFT , BEAT , Algorand  extend reliable broadcast and Byzantine agreement to blockchain scenarios. Committee-based PoS protocols, such as Ouroboros , Snow White , Bentov's CoA , make use of MPC for the management of consensus committee and block proposal. PoET  and PoTS  leverage trusted execution environment (TEE) for secure block proposal and mining substitution.\nFurthermore, some proposals incorporate innovative cryptographic primitives for enhancing privacy of network participants. Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) and ring signatures are used by Zerocash  and Monero  to construct privacy-preserving transactions that hide essential transaction values and sender-receiver addresses; Algorand and Ouroboros Praos  use cryptographic sortition and VRF for the PoS-based election of consensus committee without revealing participant's stake value. The privacy of consensus participants in large-scale permissionless blockchains is still a fresh research topic.\nBesides increased sophistication in design, new protocol proposals are also often accompanied by formal security analysis, via security frameworks such as the \\textit{random oracle model}  and \\textit{universal composibility} . In summary, This paradigm shift has brought the design and analysis of blockchain consensus protocols into formal scientific research, echoing Cachin et al.  that blockchain design should follow the rigor established by prevailing wisdom.\n}\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{figures/trilemma.png}\n    \\caption{Illustration of the security-decentralization-scalability trilemma.}\n    \\label{fig:trilemma}\n\\end{figure}", "cites": [1299, 8437, 1296, 7051], "cite_extract_rate": 0.19047619047619047, "origin_cites_number": 21, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes cited papers by tracing a clear evolution from heuristic-based to formalized consensus protocol design.
