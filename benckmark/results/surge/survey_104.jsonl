Researchers have developed numerous technologies for this task in a wide range of applications~.\nText generation takes text (e.g., a sequence, keywords) as input, processes the input text into semantic representations, and generates desired output text.\nFor example, machine translation generates text in a different language based on the source text; summarization generates an abridged version of the source text to include salient information; question answering (QA) generates textual answers to given questions; dialogue system supports chatbots to communicate with humans with generated responses.\nWith the recent resurgence of deep learning technologies~, deep neural NLG models have achieved remarkable performance in enabling machines to understand and generate natural language. A basic definition of the text generation task is to generate an expected \\emph{output sequence} from a given \\emph{input sequence}, called sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq). \nThe Seq2Seq task and model were first introduced in 2014~. It maps an input text to an output text under encoder-decoder schemes. The encoder maps the input sequence to a fixed-sized vector, and the decoder maps the vector to the target sequence.\nSince then, developing NLG systems has rapidly become a hot topic. Various text generation models have been proposed under deep neural encoder-decoder architectures. Popular architectures include recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder~, convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder-decoder~, and Transformer encoder-decoder~.\nNevertheless, the input text alone contains limited knowledge to support neural generation models to produce the desired output.\nMeanwhile, the aforementioned methods generally suffer from an inability to well comprehend language, employ memory to retain and recall knowledge, and reason over complex concepts and relational paths; as indicated by their name, they involve encoding an input sequence, providing limited reasoning by transforming their hidden state given the input, and then decoding to an output.\nTherefore, the performance of generation is still far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. For example, in dialogue systems, conditioning on only the input text, a text generation system often produces trivial or non-committal responses of frequent words or phrases in the corpus~, such as \\emph{``Me too.''} or \\emph{``Oh my god!''} given the input text \\emph{``My skin is so dry.''} These mundane responses lack meaningful content, in contrast to human responses rich in knowledge. In comparison, humans are constantly acquiring, understanding, and storing knowledge from \\emph{broader sources} so that they can be employed to understand the current situation in communicating, reading, and writing. For example, in conversations, people often first select \\emph{concepts from related topics} (e.g., sports, food), then organize those topics into understandable content to respond; for summarization, people tend to write summaries containing \\emph{keywords} used in the input document and perform necessary modifications to ensure grammatical correctness and fluency; in question answering (QA), people use \\emph{commonsense} or \\emph{professional knowledge} pertained to the question to infer the answer. Therefore, it is often the case that knowledge beyond the input sequence is required to produce informative output text.\n\\vspace{-0.05in}", "cites": [166, 9147, 2401, 2002, 790, 38], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6, "origin_cites_number": 10, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple papers by connecting foundational sequence-to-sequence models (Paper 3, 5, 6) with the broader context of neural language generation (Paper 2) and deep learning (Paper 1), showing how they relate to the challenge of knowledge incorporation.

In existing work, there are two mainstream methods to represent topics obtained from generative topic models. The first way is to use the generated topic distributions for each word (i.e., word distributions over topics) in the input sequence~. The second way is to assign a specific topic to the input sequence, then picks the top-$k$ words with the highest probabilities under the topic, and use word embeddings (e.g., GloVe) to represent topic words~. Explicitly making use of topic words can bring stronger guidance than topic distributions, but the guidance may deviate from the target output sequence when some generated topic words are irrelevant.\nZhang et al. proposed the first work of using a topic-informed Seq2Seq model by concatenating the topic distributions with encoder and decoder hidden states~.\nXing et al. designed a topic-aware Seq2Seq model in order to use topic words as prior knowledge to help dialogue generation~. \n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Natural language generation methods that incorporate topic knowledge in text generation.

In neural topic models, Dirichlet distributions can be employed as the prior to generate the parameters of the multinomial distribution $\\theta_d$ for each document~. The generative process of LDA is represented as: (1) $\\theta_d \\sim \\mathrm{Dirichlet} (\\alpha)$; (2) $t_i \\sim \\mathrm{Multinomial} (\\theta_d)$; (3) $w_i \\sim \\mathrm{Multinomial} (\\beta_{t_i})$,\nwhere $d$ denotes the bag-of-words representation of a document, $t_i$ represents the topic assignment for word $w_i$, and $\\beta_{t_i}$ represents the topic distribution over words given topic assignment $t_i$. \nHowever, a directed generative model comes up against the problem of establishing low variance gradient estimators. Miao et al. parameterized the multinomial distributions with neural networks and jointly learned the model parameters via variational inference~. They created neural structures for constructing topic distributions conditioned on a draw from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, represented as \n$\\theta_d\\sim\\mathrm{G} (\\mu_0, \\sigma_0^2)$,\nwhere $\\mathrm{G} (\\mu_0, \\sigma_0^2)$ is composed of a neural network conditioned on an isotropic Gaussian $\\mathrm{N} (\\mu_0, \\sigma_0^2)$. \nTaking a Gaussian prior distribution makes re-parameterization feasible to build an unbiased and low-variance gradient estimator for the variational distribution~. Without conjugacy prior, the updates of the parameters are derived directly and easily from the variational lower bound. Formally, a variational lower bound\nfor the document log-likelihood is:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\setlength\\abovedisplayskip{2pt} \n    \\setlength\\belowdisplayskip{2pt}\n    \\mathcal{J}_{topic} = \\mathbb{E}_{q(\\theta|d)} [\\log p(d|\\beta, \\theta)] - \\mathrm{KL} (q(\\theta|d)||p(\\theta |\\mu_0, \\sigma^2_0)),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $q(\\theta|d)$ is the variational distribution approximating the true posterior $p(\\theta|d)$. Its lower bound is estimate by sampling $\\theta$ from $q(\\theta|d) = \\mathrm{G}(\\theta|\\mu(d), \\sigma^2(d))$. \nIn order to combine neural topic model and neural generation model, the idea is to use the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)~. It adopts autoregressive networks (e.g., LSTM) both as the encoder and decoder. VAE can learn latent codes $z$ of texts by reconstructing texts with its decoder. It assumes that the generation process is controlled by codes in a continuous latent space. This kind of VAE implementation considers sequential information of texts that can model the linguistic structure of texts. Wang et al. proposed topic guided variational autoencoder (TGVAE), to draw latent code $z$ from a topic-dependent Gaussian Mixture Prior in order to incorporate the topical knowledge into latent variables~. The topic-dependent Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is defined as:\n$p(z|\\beta, t) = \\sum^{T}_{i=1} t_i \\mathrm{N} (\\mu(\\beta_i), \\sigma^2(\\beta_i))$,\nwhere $T$ is the number of topics, $\\mu(d)$ and $\\sigma^2(d)$ are functions implemented by MLP. TGVAE uses bag-of-words as input and embeds an input document into a topic vector. The topic vector is then used to reconstruct the bag-of-words input, and the learned topic distribution over words is used to model a topic-dependent prior to generate an output sequence $Y$ from conditioned on an input sequence $X$. \nTherefore, to maximize the log-likelihood log $p(Y,d|X)$, a variational objective function is constructed as:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\setlength\\abovedisplayskip{2pt} \n    \\setlength\\belowdisplayskip{2pt}\n    \\mathcal{J}_{seq2seq} = \\mathbb{E}_{q(z|X)} [\\log p(Y|X, z)] - \\mathbb{E}_{q(\\theta|d)} [\\mathrm{KL} (q(z|X)||p(z|\\beta, \\theta))],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $q(z|X)$ is variational distributions for $z$. The combined object function is given by:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\setlength\\abovedisplayskip{2pt} \n    \\setlength\\belowdisplayskip{2pt}\n    \\mathcal{J} = \\mathcal{J}_{topic} +  \\mathcal{J}_{seq2seq}.\n\\end{equation}", "cites": [3137, 5680], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key ideas from the two cited papers by integrating neural topic modeling with variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enhance text generation.

Besides, topic models can be easily used and integrated into generation frameworks. For example, topic words can be represented as word embeddings; topic embeddings can be integrated into the decoding phase through topic attention. However,\nLDA models are separated from the training process of generation, so they cannot adapt to the diversity of dependencies between input and output sequences.\nFor \\textbf{M2}, it is an end-to-end neural framework that simultaneously learns latent topic representations and generates output sequences. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are often used to generate the latent topics through iterative convolution and pooling operations. However, theoretical analysis is missing to ensure the quality of the topics captured by the convolutions. And their interpretability is not as good as the LDA-based topic models.\nFor \\textbf{M3}, neural topic models combine the advantages of neural networks and probabilistic topic models. They enable back propagation for joint optimization, contributing to more coherent topics, and can be scaled to large data sets. Generally, neural topic models can provide better topic coherence than LDAs~. However, neural variational approaches share a same drawback that topic distribution is assumed to be an isotropic Gaussian, which makes them incapable of modeling topic correlations. Existing neural topic models assume that the documents should be i.i.d. to adopt VAE, while they are commonly correlated. The correlations are critical for topic modeling.\n\\vspace{-0.05in}", "cites": [3127], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 4.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section offers a clear analytical comparison between three different methods of incorporating topic-based internal knowledge into NLG.

The mainstream methods of keyword acquisition for documents can be divided into two categories~: keyword assignment and keyword extraction. Keyword assignment means that keywords are chosen from a controlled vocabulary of terms or predefined taxonomy.\nKeyword extraction selects the most representative words explicitly presented in the document, which is independent from any vocabulary. Keyword extraction techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, TextRank, PMI) have been widely used over decades. Many NLG tasks can benefit from incorporating such a condensed form of essential content in a document to maintain the semantic coherence and guide the generation process.\nNext, we introduce popular NLG applications enhanced by keywords:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Dialogue system.} Keywords help enlighten and drive the generated responses to be informative and avoid generating universally relevant replies which carry little semantics. Besides, \n    recent work introduced personalized information into the generation of dialogue to help deliver better dialogue response such as emotion ~, and persona~.\n    \\item \\textbf{Summarization.} \n    Vanilla Seq2Seq models often suffer when the generation process is hard to control and often misses salient information~. Making use of keywords as explicit guidance can provide significant clues of the main points about the document~.

It has a great number of triples composed of subjects, predicates, and objects. People also call them ``facts'' or ``factual triplets''.

For example, the target task is answer sequence generation, and additional tasks include question understanding and fact retrieval in the KB.

The reason is that different kinds of selected knowledge facts can be used to generate diverse responses for the same input utterance. Given a specific utterance and response pair, the posterior distribution over knowledge base from both the utterance and the response may provide extra guidance on knowledge selection. The challenge lies in the discrepancy between the prior and posterior distributions.

A KG is a structured representation of facts (a.k.a. knowledge triplets) consisting of entities\\footnote{For brevity, we use “entities” to denote both entities (e.g., prince) and concepts (e.g., musician) throughout the paper.}, relations, and semantic descriptions~. The terms of “knowledge base” and “knowledge graph” can be interchangeably used, but they do not have to be synonymous. The knowledge graph is organized as a graph, so the connections between entities are first-class citizens in it. {In the KG, people can easily traverse links to discover how entities are interconnected to express certain knowledge.} Recent advances in artificial intelligence research have demonstrated the effectiveness of using KGs in various applications like recommendation systems~.\nNext, we introduce popular NLG applications that have been enhanced by knowledge graph:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Commonsense reasoning.} It aims to empower machines to capture the human commonsense from KG during generation.\n    The methods exploit both structural and semantic information of the commonsense KG and perform reasoning over multi-hop relational paths, in order to augment the limited information with chains of evidence for commonsense reasoning. Popular tasks in commonsense reasoning generation include abductive reasoning (e.g., the $\\alpha$NLG task)~, counterfactual reasoning~, and entity description generation~. \n    \\item \\noindent\\textbf{Dialogue system.} It frequently makes use of KG for the semantics in linked entities and relations~. A dialogue may shift focus from one entity to another, breaking one discourse into several segments, which can be represented as a linked path connecting the entities and their relations.\n    \\item \\noindent\\textbf{Creative writing.} This task can be found in both scientific and story-telling domains. Scientific writing aims to explain natural processes and phenomena step by step, so each step can be reflected as a link on KG and the whole explanation is a path~. In story generation, the implicit knowledge in KG can facilitate the understanding of storyline and better predict what will happen in the next plot~.\n\\end{itemize}\nCompared with separate, independent knowledge triplets, knowledge graph provides comprehensive and rich entity features and relations for models to overcome the influence of the data distribution and enhance its robustness.\nTherefore, node embedding and relational path have played important roles in various text generation tasks. The corresponding techniques are knowledge graph embedding (KGE)~ and path-based knowledge graph reasoning~. Furthermore, it has been possible to encode multi-hop and high-order relations in KGs using the emerging graph neural network (GNN)~ and graph-to-sequence (Graph2Seq) frameworks~.\n\\vspace{-0.05in}\n\\begin{definition}[Knowledge graph (KG)]\nA knowledge graph (KG) is a directed and multi-relational graph composed of entities and relations which are regarded as nodes and different types of edges.

The model would have to learn to bridge the gap, which might make a negative impact on the performance of text generation.\nFine tuning pre-trained language models on the KG triplets (\\textbf{M2}) can eliminate the gap between the two vector spaces.\nNevertheless, M1 and M2 share two drawbacks.\nFirst, they only preserve information of direct (one-hop) relations in a KG, such as pair-wise proximity in M1 and KG triplet in M2, but ignore the indirect (multi-hop) relations of concepts. The indirect relations may provide plausible evidence of complex reasoning for some text generation tasks.\nSecond, from the time KGs were encoded in M1 or M2 methods, the generation models would no longer be able to access the KGs but their continuous representations. Then the models could not support reasoning like commonsense KG reasoning for downstream tasks.\nDue to these two reasons, M1 and M2 were often used to create basic KG representations upon which the KG path reasoning (M3) and GNNs (M4) could further enrich the hidden states~.\nThe path finding methods of KG reasoning (\\textbf{M3}) perform multi-hop walks on the KGs beyond one-hop relations. It enables reasoning that is needed in many text generation scenarios such as commonsense reasoning and conversational question answering.\nAt the same time, it provides better interpretability for the entire generation process, because the path selected by the KG reasoning algorithm will be explicitly used for generation.\nHowever, the selected paths might not be able to capture the full contexts of the reasoning process due to the limit of number.\nBesides, reinforcement-learning based path finding uses heuristic rewards to drive the policy search, making the model sensitive to noises and adversarial examples.\nThe algorithms of GNN and Graph2Seq (\\textbf{M4}) can effectively aggregate semantic and structural information from multi-hop neighborhoods on KGs, compared to M3 that considers multi-hop paths.\nTherefore, the wide range of relevant information can be directly embedded into the encoder/decoder hidden states. Meanwhile, M4 enables back propagation for jointly optimizing text encoder and graph encoder. \nFurthermore, the attention mechanism that has been applied in GNN and Graph2Seq (e.g., graph attention) can explain the model's output at some extent, though the multi-hop paths from M3 has better interpretability.\nM3 and M4 are able to use multi-hop relational information, compared to M1 and M2. However, they have two weak points. First, they have higher complexity than M1 and M2. In M3, the action space of path finding algorithms can be very large due to the large size and sparsity of the knowledge graph. In M4, the decoder has to attentively read both input sequence and knowledge graph.

The textual information may not be found in training corpora or structured databases, but can be obtained from massive textual data from online resources. These online resources include encyclopedia (e.g., Wikipedia), social media (e.g., Twitter), shopping \nwebsites (e.g., Amazon reviews). Knowledge grounded text plays an important role in understanding the input sequence and its surrounding contexts. For example, Wikipedia articles may offer textual explanations or background information for the input text. Amazon reviews may contain necessary descriptions and reviews needed to answer a product-related question. Tweets may contain people's comments and summaries towards an event.\nTherefore, knowledge grounded text is often taken as an important external knowledge source to help with a variety of NLG applications.\nNext, we introduce popular NLG applications enhanced by knowledge grounded text:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Dialogue system.} Building a fully data-driven dialogue system is difficult since most of the universal knowledge is not presented in the training corpora~. The lack of universal knowledge considerably limits the appeal of fully data-driven generation methods, as they are bounded to respond evasively or defectively and seldom include meaningfully factual contents. To infuse the response with factual information, an intelligent machine is expected to obtain necessary background information to produce appropriate response.\n    \\item \\noindent\\textbf{Summarization.} Seq2Seq models that purely depend on the input text tend to ``lose control'' sometimes. For example, 3\\% of summaries contain less than three words, and 4\\% of summaries repeat a word for more than 99 times as mentioned in~. Furthermore, Seq2Seq models usually focus on copying source words in their exact order, which is often sub-optimal in abstractive summarization. Therefore, leveraging summaries of documents similar as the input document as templates can provide reference for the summarization process~.\n    \\item \\noindent\\textbf{Question answering (QA).} It is often difficult to generate proper answers only based on the given question. For example, without knowing any information of an Amazon product, it is hard to deliver satisfactory answer to the user questions such as \\emph{``Does the laptop have a long battery life?''} or \\emph{``Is this refrigerator frost-free?''} So, the product description and customer reviews can be used as a reference for answering product-related questions~.\n\\end{itemize}\nTo handle different kinds of relationships between grounded text and input/output sequences, these methods can be categorized into two methodologies as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:overall_kt}: (M1) guiding generation with retrieved information; (M2) modeling background knowledge into response generation.\n\\vspace{-0.05in}", "cites": [2005, 3130], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section introduces the concept of knowledge grounded text and lists a few NLG applications enhanced by it, such as dialogue systems, summarization, and QA.

Existing text generation benchmarks did not specially focus on choosing the tasks and datasets that have been widely used for knowledge-enhanced text generation. Therefore, we re-screened from the existing four text generation benchmarks, i.e., GLGE~, GEM~, KilT~, GENIE~, and determined 9 benchmark datasets for evaluating knowledge-enhanced NLG methods. Here is our criteria for selection:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We only consider benchmark datasets that have open-access downloading link.\n    \\item We focus on diverse text generation tasks, involving various applications.\n    \\item We select at most three benchmark datasets for each text generation task.\n    \\item We include a mix of internal and external knowledge focused datasets.\n    \\item We prefer multi-reference datasets for robust automatic evaluation.\n\\end{itemize}\nBased on the benchmark selection criteria, we finalize 9 knowledge-centric tasks that covers various NLG tasks, including commonsense reasoning, text summarization, question generation, generative question answering, and dialogue. The data statistics is shown in Table \\ref{tab:benchmark}. Descriptions and dataset links are listed as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Wizard of Wikipedia (WOW):} It is an open-domain dialogue dataset, where two speakers conduct an open-ended conversion that is directly grounded with knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia. (Data link: \\url{https://parl.ai/projects/wizard\\_of\\_wikipedia/})\n    \\item \\textbf{CommonGen:} It is a generative commonsense reasoning dataset. Given a set of common concepts, the task is to generate a coherent sentence describing an everyday scenario using these concepts. (Data link: \\url{https://inklab.usc.edu/CommonGen/})\n    \\item \\textbf{$\\alpha$NLG-ART:}  It is a generative commonsense reasoning dataset. Given the incomplete observations about the world, the task it to generate a valid hypothesis about the likely explanations to partially observable past and future. (Data link: \\url{http://abductivecommonsense.xyz/})\n    \\item \\textbf{ComVE:}  It is a generative commonsense reasoning dataset. The task is to generate an explanation given a counterfactual statement for sense-making. (Data link: \\url{https://github.com/wangcunxiang/SemEval2020-Task4-Commonsense-Validation-and-Explanation}\n    \\item \\textbf{ELI5:} It is a dataset for long-form question answering. The task is to produce explanatory multi-sentence answers for diverse questions. Web search results are used as evidence documents to answer questions. (Data link: \\url{https://facebookresearch.github.io/ELI5/})\n    \\item \\textbf{SQuAD:} It is a dataset for answer-aware question generation. The task is to generate a question asks towards the given answer span based on a given text passage or document. (Data link: \\url{https://github.com/magic282/NQG})\n    \\item \\textbf{CNN/DailyMail (CNN/DM):} It is a dataset for summarization. Given a news aticles, the goal is to produce a summary that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content. (Data link: \\url{https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cnn_dailymail})\n    \\item \\textbf{Gigaword:} It is a dataset for summarization. Similar with CNN/DM, the goal is to generate a headline for a news article.
