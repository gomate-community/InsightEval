Compared with other popular biometrics such as fingerprint, iris, palm, and vein, the face has a significantly better potential to recognize the identity in a non-intrusive manner. Therefore, face recognition is widely used in many application domains such as surveillance, forensics, and border control. With the development of deep learning techniques~ and the publicly available large-scale face datasets~, face recognition performance has improved substantially~. However, face recognition systems still tend to perform far from satisfactory when encountering challenges such as large-pose variation, varying illumination, low resolution, different facial expressions, and occlusion. Generally, face images stored in a gallery are of high quality and free from the above degradations, while probe faces are suffering from what can be seen as \\textit{a missing data problem} due to these challenges. Consequently, fewer facial parts are available for recognition, which induces a mismatch between feature available in probe faces and gallery faces.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{figures/occlusion_examples.pdf}\n\\caption{Examples of occluded face images from the MAFA dataset.}\n\\label{fig:occlusion_examples}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.1}\n\\caption{A categorization of Occlusion Challenges}\\label{tab:occlusion_challenges}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabularx}{0.5\\textwidth}{|l|X|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Occlusion Scenario} & \\textbf{Examples} \\\\\n\\hline\nFacial accessories & eyeglasses, sunglasses, scarves, mask, hat, hair\\\\\nExternal occlusions & occluded by hands and random objects\\\\\nLimited field of view & partial faces\\\\\nSelf-occlusions& non-frontal pose\\\\\nExtreme illumination& part of face highlighted\\\\\n\\hline\n\\multirow{3}{*}{Artificial Occlusions}&random black rectangles\\\\\n&random white rectangles\\\\\n&random salt \\& pepper noise\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabularx}\n\\end{table}\nFacial occlusion~ is considered one of the most intractable problems because we do not have prior knowledge about the occluded part, which can be anywhere and of any size or shape in a face image. From a practical point of view, it is not feasible to collect a large-scale training dataset with all possible occlusions in a realistic scenario to use deep learning techniques. Therefore, the problem of face recognition under occlusions remains a challenge. Facial occlusion occurs when the subject wears accessories such as a scarf, a face mask, glasses, a hat, etc., or when random objects are present in front of the face. The recognition accuracy has been compromised in some way because of the higher inter-class similarity and the more considerable intra-class variations caused by occlusion. Facial appearance changes substantially due to occlusion, as illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:occlusion_examples}. We present a categorization of occlusion challenges in different scenarios with their typical occlusion examples (see Table~\\ref{tab:occlusion_challenges}). Pose variation can partially be seen as a self-occlusion problem caused by a large rotation of the head. The self-occlusion problem due to pose variation is usually dealt with in pose correction and therefore not discussed here.\n{In most cases, occluded face recognition~(OFR) involves querying a gallery consisting of occlusion-free faces using a probe image from an alternative test dataset of occluded faces. Occluded faces rely on either the collection of real occlusions or synthetic occlusions. We first break down OFR research scenarios in the most obvious way by the pairs of images considered. Fig.~\\ref{fig:OFR_problems} offers an illustration of the five categories regarding OFR testing scenarios. More specifically, five widely used testing scenarios for OFR, ranging from most real to least real, are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{Real occlusions}: gallery images are mugshots free from occlusion while probe images are faces occluded by realistic images such as sunglasses, or a scarf.\n  \\item \\textbf{Partial faces}: gallery images are mugshots free from occlusion while test face images are partial faces; hence the name partial face recognition is given by researchers.\n  \\item \\textbf{Synthetic occlusions}: gallery images are faces in the wild which are captured from uncontrolled scenarios while probe faces are blocked with synthetic occlusions to simulate real occlusions. \n  \\item \\textbf{Occluding rectangle}: gallery images are occlusion-free mugshots while test face images are occluded with a rectangle such as white and black rectangles.\n  \\item \\textbf{Occluding unrelated images}: gallery images are mugshots free from occlusion while test face images are occluded with unrelated images such as a baboon, or a non-square image.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{figures/OFR_problems.pdf}\n\\caption{Different occluded face recognition testing scenarios involved in OFR.}\n\\label{fig:OFR_problems}\n\\end{figure}\n}\nApproaches to recognizing faces under occlusions can be broadly classified into three categories~(shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:methods_category}), which are 1) occlusion robust feature extraction~(ORFE), 2) occlusion aware face recognition~(OAFR) and 3) occlusion recovery based face recognition~(ORecFR). An OFR system consists of three components, each corresponding to an important design decision: cross-occlusion strategy, feature extraction, and comparison strategy. Of these components, the second and third have analogues in general face recognition, while cross-occlusion strategy is unique to OFR.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{ORFE category} searches for a feature space that is less affected by facial occlusions. Generally, patch-based engineered and learning-based features are used as the cross-occlusion strategy.\n\\item \\textbf{OAFR category} is explicitly aware where the occlusion is. Generally, occlusion-discard is applied as the cross-occlusion strategy. As a result, only visible face parts qualify for face recognition~(i.e., feature extraction, feature comparison). Furthermore, we classify partial face recognition approaches as OAFR because they exclude occlusion parts from face recognition, assuming that visible parts are ready in the beginning.\n\\item \\textbf{ORecFR category} intends to recover an occlusion-free face from the occluded face to meet the demands of conventional face recognition systems. In other words, it takes occlusion recovery as the cross-occlusion strategy.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figures/methods_category.pdf}\n\\caption{The three categories of methods for face recognition under occlusion challenges.}\n\\label{fig:methods_category}\n\\end{figure}\nNumerous methods have been proposed to push the frontier of face recognition research. Several comprehensive surveys~ have been published for face recognition under occlusion. Of the existing works, the survey by Lahasan et al.~ on face recognition under occlusion challenges presents a thorough overview of the approaches before 2017, which is the most relevant to this paper. However, there are at least two reasons why a new survey on occluded face recognition is needed. \\textit{First, the explosive growth of face recognition techniques these years has stimulated many innovative contributions to handle occluded face recognition problems.} The increased number of publications over the last few years calls for a new survey for occluded face recognition, including up-to-date approaches, especially deep learning techniques. \\textit{Second, several large-scale occluded face datasets have become publicly available in recent years.} Without large-scale training data of occluded face images, deep learning models cannot function well~. Recently, the MAFA dataset~ is accessible for occluded face detection, and the IJB-C dataset~ is introduced as a general evaluation benchmark to include meta-information regarding the occlusion~(i.e., occlusion location, occlusion degree). Predictably, these datasets would encourage occluded face recognition to develop faster. The proposed survey provides a systematic categorization of methods for face recognition. Specifically, occluded face detection techniques are briefly reviewed because an OFR system requires the application of occluded face detection as the first step. Moreover, newly published and innovative papers addressing occlusion problems are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we represent comparative performance evaluations in terms of occluded face detection and face recognition on widely used datasets as well as newly-developed large-scale datasets.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: occluded face detection techniques are introduced in Section 2. Methods of occlusion robust feature extraction are described and analyzed in Section 3. We review occlusion-aware face recognition approaches in Section 4. Then Section 5 briefly studies occlusion-recovery face recognition methods. A performance evaluation of the reviewed approaches is given in Section 6. In section 7, we discuss future challenges to datasets as well as to research. Finally, we draw an overall conclusion for occluded face recognition.", "cites": [1214, 1222, 514, 1218, 305, 97, 1219, 1220, 1221, 1210, 1216, 8426, 1215, 1217], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5384615384615384, "origin_cites_number": 26, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of occluded face recognition (OFR) challenges and categorizes existing approaches, but it integrates cited papers minimally and primarily for context rather than to build a deeper synthesis.

It is challenging due to large-pose variation, varying illumination, low resolution, and occlusion etc.~. Approaches to general face detection can roughly be classified into three categories, which are \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Rigid templates based face detection.\n\\item Deformable part models~(DPM) based face detection.\n\\item Deep convolutional neural networks~(DCNNs) based face detection. \n\\end{itemize}\nThe Viola-Jones face detector and its variations~ are typical in the rigid templates based category, which utilizes Haar-like features and AdaBoost to train cascaded classifiers and can achieve good performance with real-time efficiency. However, the performance of these methods can drop dramatically when handling real-world application~. In contrast, DPM based face detection can achieve significantly better performance based on the cost of high computational complexity~. A third, most promising category of research is DCNNs based face detection~. Some methods~ joint face detection with face alignment to exploit their inherent correlation to boost the performance. There are two major branches of object detection framework: (i)~region proposals based CNN~(i.e.,two-stage detectors), such as R-CNN~, fast R-CNN~, faster R-CNN~; (ii)~region proposals free CNN~(i.e.,one-stage detectors), such as the Single-Shot Multibox Detector~(SSD)~, YOLO~. In short, two-stage detectors achieve higher performance but are time-consuming. One-stage detectors have significant computational advantages but compensate by less accurate detection results. Some methods~ treat a face as a natural object and adopt techniques from object detection in face detection. Most recently, finding tiny faces has become popular in face detection and superior performance has been achieved~. \nRecent years have witnessed promising results of exploring DCNNs for face detection with the introduction of Widerface~, which offers a wide pose variation, significant scale difference~(tiny face), expression variation, make-up, severe illumination, and occlusion. Up to now, Feature Agglomeration Networks~(FANet)~, a single-stage face detector, achieves the state-of-art performance on several face detection benchmarks include the FDDB~, the PASCAL Face~, and the Widerface benchmark~. To exploit inherent multi-scale features of a single convolutional neural network, FANet introduced an Agglomeration Connection module to enhance the context-aware features and augment low-level feature maps with a hierarchical structure so that it can cope with scale variance in face detection effectively. Besides, Hierarchical Loss is proposed to train FANet to become stable and better in an end-to-end way. \\textbf{In short, methods that achieve remarkable detection performance, for example on the Widerface dataset, also provide a solid solution for occluded face detection.}", "cites": [1223, 8428, 1226, 8429, 206, 1229, 1227, 802, 1224, 8427, 1231, 209, 1228, 1230, 1225], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6, "origin_cites_number": 25, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key developments in face detection under occlusion by organizing methods into three coherent categories and drawing connections between them.

At the same time, detecting occluded pedestrians is a long-standing research topic that has been intensively studied during the past few decades. Therefore, many researchers borrow techniques from pedestrian detection~ to push the frontier of occluded face detection by treating occlusion as the dominating challenge during the detection. \\textbf{Most occluded face detection methods report their performance on the MAFA dataset~ while general face detection methods do not, which means it is not a level playing field for general face detection and occluded face detection.} Approaches to detect partially occluded faces are roughly clustered as 1)~locating visible facial segments to estimate a full face; 2)~fusing the detection results obtained from face sub-regions to mitigate the negative impact of occlusion; 3)~using the occlusion information to help face detection in an adversarial way.", "cites": [7338], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section shows moderate synthesis by connecting occluded face detection with techniques from pedestrian detection, referencing one relevant paper.

A set of attribute-aware CNNs are trained with specific part-level facial attributes (e.g., mouth attributes such as big lips, open mouth, smiling, wearing lipstick) to generate facial response maps. Next, a scoring mechanism is proposed to compute the degree of face likeliness by analyzing their spatial arrangement. Finally, face classification and bounding box regression are jointly trained with the face proposals, resulting in precise face locations.

As a result, this method could achieve excellent performance on the Active Authentication Dataset (AA-01)~. However, the use of simple architecture increases speed by compromising detection accuracy.\nThe introduction of MAFA~ offers plenty of faces wearing various masks, which  contributes significantly to the occluded face detection, especially of masked faces.

One promising approach is to use a novel grid loss~, which has been incorporated into the convolutional neural network to handle partial occlusion in face detection. It is based on the observation that partial occlusions would confuse a subset of detectors, whereas the remaining ones can still make correct predictions. To this end, this work regards occluded face detection as a particular single-class object detection problem, inspired by other works on object detection~. Furthermore, the proposed grid loss minimizes the error rate on face sub-blocks independently rather than over the whole face to mitigate the adverse effect of partial occlusions and to observe improved face detection accuracy. \nUsing the occluded area as an auxiliary rather than a hindrance is a feasible solution to help face detection adversely. Adversarial occlusion-aware face detection (AOFD)~ is proposed to detect occluded faces and segment the occlusion area simultaneously. They integrate a masking strategy into AOFD to mimic different occlusion situations. More specifically, a mask generator is designed to mask the distinctive part of a face in a training set, forcing the detector to learn what is possibly a face in an adversarial way. Besides, an occlusion segmentation branch is introduced to help detect incomplete faces. The proposed multitask training method showed superior performance on general as well as masked face detection benchmarks.

The matching method is used to calculate the distance between corresponding representations of two faces. To take advantage of elastic and partial matching, Ref.~ proposes a robust matching metric to match Difference of Gaussian~(DoG) filter descriptor of a facial part against its spatial neighborhood in the other faces and select the minimal distance for face recognition.

In paper~, artificial occlusions are included to construct training data for training sparse and dense hybrid representation framework. The results show that artificially introduced occlusions are important to obtain discriminative features. Structured occlusion coding~(SOC)~ is proposed to employ an occlusion-appended dictionary to simultaneously separate the occlusion and classify the face. In this case, with the use of corresponding parts of the dictionary, face and occlusion can be represented respectively, making it possible to handle large occlusion, like a scarf. In paper~, efficient locality-constrained occlusion coding~(ELOC) is proposed to greatly reduce the running time without sacrificing too much accuracy, inspired by the observation that it is possible to estimate the occlusion using identity-unrelated samples.\nRecently, another work~ attempts face recognition with single sample per person and intends to achieve robustness and effectiveness for complex facial variations such as occlusions. It proposes a joint and collaborative representation with local adaptive convolution feature~(ACF), containing local high-level features from local regular regions. The joint and collaborative representation framework requires ACFs extracted from different local areas to have similar coefficients regarding a representation dictionary. Ref.~ proposes to learn a robust and discriminative low-rank representation~(RDLRR) for optimal classification, which aiming to prepare the learned representations optimally for classification as well as to capture the global structure of data and the holistic structure of each occlusion induced error image. The results demonstrate that the method can yield better performance in case of illumination changes, real occlusion as well as block occlusion.\nRef.~ combines center-symmetric local binary patterns~(CSLBP) with enhanced center-symmetric local binary patterns~(ECSLBP) to build the SRC dictionary for occluded face recognition. In Ref.~, discriminative multi-scale sparse coding~(DMSC) is proposed to address single-sample face recognition with different kinds of occlusion. More specifically, it learns the auxiliary dictionary to model the possible occlusion variations from external data based on PCA and proposes a multi-scale error measurement strategy to detect and disregard outlier pixels due to occlusion. Ref~ proposes a hierarchical sparse and low-rank regression model and uses features based on image gradient direction, leading to a weak low-rankness optimization problem. The model is suited for occluded face recognition and yields better recognition accuracy. In another work, NNAODL~(nuclear norm based adapted occlusion dictionary learning)~ has been proposed to construct corrupted regions and non-corrupted regions for occluded face recognition. The same occlusion parts in training images are used to construct the occlusions while normal training images are used to reconstruct non-occlusion regions, leading to improved computing efficiency. To cope with occluded face recognition with limited training samples, Ref.~ proposes a structural element feature extraction method to capture the local and contextual information inspired by the human optic nerve characteristics for face recognition. Besides, an adaptive fusion method is proposed to use multiple features consisting of a structural element feature, and a connected-granule labeling feature. It applies Reinforced Centrosymmetric Local Binary Pattern~(RCSLBP) to better handle the robustness to the occlusion. Finally, few-shot sparse representation learning is applied for few-shot occluded face recognition.", "cites": [1242, 1241], "cite_extract_rate": 0.16666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 12, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of various learning-based feature extraction methods, particularly focusing on the use of sparse representation classifiers for occluded face recognition.

Face\nverification performance has been boosted due to advanced\ndeep CNN architectures~ and the development\nof loss functions~. From a practical point of view, we can obtain occlusion-robust face representation if a massive training dataset is provided to contain sufficient occluded faces for a deep network to learn to handle occlusions~. However, it is tough to collect such a dataset. Data augmentation seems to be a plausible solution to obtain a large number of occluded faces. Training with augmented occluded faces ensures the features are extracted more locally and equally~. Lv et al.~ synthesize occluded faces with various hairstyles and glasses for data augmentation to enlarge the training dataset, which alleviates the impact of occlusions. Specifically, $87$ common hairstyle templates with various bangs and $100$ glasses templates are collected to synthesize training face images with different hairstyles and face images with different glasses, to enable the CNN model is robust to various hairstyles and glasses. The method indeed relieves the data deficiency problem and results in improved performance. However, its use is limited to handling sunglasses and hair in recognition and does not solve the occlusion problem in general. In paper~, instead of using synthetic occluded faces directly, they first identify the importance of face regions in an occlusion sensitivity experiment and then train a CNN with identified face regions covered to reduce the model's reliance on these regions. Specifically, they propose to augment the training set with face images with occlusions located in high-effect regions~(the central part of the face) more frequently than in low effect regions~(the outer parts of the face). This forces the model to learn more discriminative features from the outer parts of the face, resulting in less degradation when the central part is occluded. However, pre-defined occlusions may cause performance degradation when dealing with face images with an occlusion that is not of the same size. Cen et al.~ propose a DDRC~(deep dictionary representation based classification) scheme to alleviate the occlusion effect in face recognition, where the dictionary is used to linearly code the deep features that are extracted from a convolutional neural network. The dictionary is composed of deep features of the training samples and an auxiliary dictionary associated with the occlusion patterns of the testing face samples. However, the proposed DDRC assumes that the occlusion pattern of the test faces is included in the auxiliary dictionary, which limits its use.", "cites": [514, 309, 305, 1218, 297, 1246, 97, 1219, 1245, 1243, 1244, 1210, 1217], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6842105263157895, "origin_cites_number": 19, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of deep learning approaches for occlusion-robust feature extraction, integrating several relevant papers to discuss methods like data augmentation and loss function design.

During face recognition, the eye region is selected when people are wearing masks or veils, and the bottom region is used when people are wearing glasses. This method has a deficiency in flexibility use because well-aligned predefined subregions are hard to obtain in the real scenario. A paper~ in this direction extends NMF to include adaptive occlusion estimation based on the reconstruction errors. Low-dimensional representations are learned to ensure that features of the same class are close to that of the mean class center.  This method does not require prior knowledge of occlusions and can handle large continuous occlusions.\nIn paper~, a proposed MaskNet is added to the middle layer of CNN models, aiming to learn image features with high fidelity and to ignore those distorted by occlusions. MaskNet is defined as a shallow convolutional network, which is expected to assign lower weights to hidden units activated by the occluded facial areas.

This method explores the discriminative power of sparse representation of a test face. It uses a linear combination of training samples plus sparse errors accounting for occlusions or corruption as its representation. To better tackle the occlusion, the SRC introduces an identity matrix as an occlusion dictionary on the assumption that the occlusion has a sparse representation in this dictionary. Ref.~ improves sparse representation by including prior knowledge of pixel error distribution. In paper~, they design a graph model-based face completion system for partially occluded face reparation. They leverage image-based data mining to find the best-matched patch to guide occluded face synthesis from the images, derived from the selection of sparse representation classification (SRC). The final face completion proceeds in the graph-based domain with the help of graph Laplace. \nSimilarly, Ref.~ proposes a reconstruction approach consisting of occlusion detection and face reconstruction. First, the downsampled SRC is used to locate all possible occlusions at a low computing complexity. Second, all discovered face pixels are imported into an overdetermined equation system to reconstruct an intact face.\nAn innovative solution for the occlusion challenge is presented by structured sparse representation based classification (SSRC)~ to learn an occlusion dictionary. The regularization term of mutual incoherence forces the resulting occlusion dictionary to be independent of the training samples. This method effectively decomposes the occluded face image into a sparse linear combination of the training sample dictionary and the occlusion dictionary. The recognition can be executed on the recovered occlusion-free face images. Nevertheless, this method requires retraining of the model to handle the different occlusions. \nIn paper~, a new criterion to compute modular weight-based SRC is proposed to address the problem of occluded face recognition. They partition a face into small modules and learn the weight function according to the Fisher rate. The modular weight is used to lessen the effect of modules with low discriminant and to detect the occlusion module. More recently, Ref.~ proposes a robust representation to model contiguous block occlusions based on two characteristics. The first characteristic introduces a tailored potential loss function to fit the errors of distribution. Specifically, a Laplacian sparse error distribution or more general distributions based on M-Estimators. The second characteristic models the error image, which is the difference between the occluded test face and the unoccluded training face of the same identity, as low-rank structural. Wang et al.~ proposed a method equipped with two stages: varying occlusion detection stage consisting of occlusion detection and elimination, and iterative recovery stage consisting of occluded parts being recovered and unoccluded parts being reserved.

The core problem in generative models is to address density estimation by unsupervised learning, which can be carried out by explicit density estimation~, or implicit density estimation~. The most prominent generative models are originated from the variational autoencoder~(VAE)~ and the generative adversarial network~(GAN)~. The traditional autoencoder is used to reconstruct data, and the VAE~ applies probabilistic spin to the traditional autoencoder to allow generating a new image. Having assumed that training data is generated from the underlying latent representation, the VAE derives a lower bound on the data likelihood that is tractable and can be optimized. This method is a principled approach to generative models, and useful features can be extracted by inference of $q(z|x)$. However, generated images are blurrier and of low quality. Instead, the GAN~ learns to generate a new image from training distribution using a minimax game between the generator network and the discriminator network. The discriminator wants to distinguish between real and fake images, while the generator wants to fool the discriminator by generating real-looking images. Ref.~ uses convolutional architectures in the GAN and can generate realistic samples. However, the GAN is notorious for unstable training characteristics. Makhzani et al.~ propose an adversarial autoencoder~(AAE) to use the GAN framework as a variational inference in a probabilistic autoencoder to ensure that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples.\nThere are GAN variants for all kinds of applications. We focus on methods that are relevant to face image editing and image inpainting. One is a blind-inpainting work~ that combines sparse coding~ and deep neural networks to tackle image denoising and inpainting. In particular, a stacked sparse denoising autoencoder is trained to learn the mapping function from generated corrupted noisy overlapping image patches to the original noise-free ones. The network is regularized by a sparsity-inducing term to avoid over-fitting. This method does not need prior information about the missing region and provides solutions to complex pattern removal like the superimposed text from an image. Context Encoders~ combine the encoder-decoder architecture with context information of the missing part by regarding inpainting as a context-based pixel prediction problem. Specifically, the encoder architecture is trained on the input images with missing parts to obtain a latent representation while the decoder architecture learns to recover the lost information by using the latent representation. Pixel-wise reconstruction loss and adversarial loss are jointly used to supervise the context encoders to learn semantic inpainting results. Several variants of context encoders~ are proposed: some extend it by defining global and local discriminators~ and some take the result of context encoders as the input and apply joint optimization of image content and texture constraints to avoid visible artifacts around the border of the hole~. Ref.~ relies on the power of the generative network to complete the corrupted image without requiring an external training dataset. A partial convolution based network~ is proposed to only consider valid pixels and apply a mechanism that can automatically generate an updated mask, resulting in robustness to image inpainting for irregular holes. Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Networks~(InfoGAN)~ maximize the mutual information between latent variables and the observation in an unsupervised way. It decomposes the input noise vector into the source of incompressible noise $z$ and the latent code $c$ which will target the salient structured semantic features of data distribution. By manipulating latent codes, several visual concepts such as different hairstyles, presence or absence of eyeglasses are discovered. Occlusion-aware GAN~ is proposed to identify a corrupted image region with an associated corrupted region recovered using a GAN pre-trained on occlusion-free faces. Ref.~ employs GAN for eyes-to-face synthesis with only eyes visible. Very recently, AttGAN, a face image editing method, has imposed attribute classification constraints to the generated image so that the desired attributes are incorporated. Hairstyles and eyeglasses that may cause occlusion in a face image are treated as attributes which can be triggered to be present or absent in the generated image. ERGAN~(Eyeglasses removal generative adversarial network)~ is proposed for eyeglasses removal in the wild in an unsupervised manner. It is capable of rendering a competitive removal quality in terms of realism and diversity. In paper~, ID-GAN~(identity-diversity generative adversarial network) combines a CNN-based recognizer and GAN-based recognition to inpaint realism and identity-preserving faces.
