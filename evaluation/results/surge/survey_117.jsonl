Even if the survey includes the three VEC layers , our survey, in order to focus on the ComOf and CachDel, defines more detail VEC layers where the edge cloud layer is further divided into vehicle edge nodes layer and static edge nodes layer. We then expand the three-layer into four-layer whereby the nodes in the edge layer are categorised into vehicle edge nodes and stationary edge nodes layers.\nFigure \\ref{fig:VEC-layer} illustrates a general four-tier VFC architecture resumed from the bottom layer, namely, smart vehicles, vehicle edge nodes, stationary edge nodes, and the top layer that is a centralised cloud. The layers are briefly explained as follows.  \\\\\n\\begin{figure*}[h]\n\t\\center{\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]\t{figures/newlayer12122019.jpg}}\n\t\\caption{A general four-layer VEC architecture}\n\t\\label{fig:VEC-layer}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\begin{itemize} \n\t\\item \\textbf{Smart Vehicles} \n\t\tAny types of vehicles that can be autonomous and equipped with OBUs, number of sensors which includes Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Global Positioning System (GPS), videos and cameras. The OBU has features of computation, storage and also networking . The smart vehicles are sometimes known as service requestors , client vehicles , task vehicles  and AVs  in the VEC architecture. The vehicles under this layer can upload or download segmented/unsegmented data to or from nearby edge nodes. The former is often described as offloading, and the latter is known as the content delivery or dissemination. \\\\\n\t\\item \\textbf{Vehicular edge nodes} \n\tSmart vehicles with available resources can establish a vehicular cloudlet and share their resources to the requesting smart vehicles within their coverage. The vehicle edge node can be considered to be a vehicle service provider  or a service vehicle . Note that the vehicles can either be in moving  or parking states .\\\\\n\t\\item \\textbf{Stationary edge nodes}\n\tAn RSU or a typical cellular BS is connected to an MEC server for a high computation and storage capability. The MEC server can be co-located at the BS  or RSU . However, the cost can be reduced if a pool of RSUs can share the MEC server. The RSU is more preferable than the BS to serve the vehicles due to its proximity to smart vehicles and mobile edge nodes . In case of that there is no RSU coverage, the BS can still provide the edge computational service.\\\\\n\t\\item \\textbf{Centralised cloud}\n\tA centralised cloud  consists of a large number of dedicated servers with great computation, storage capability, and also stable connections.

However, some works introduced different types of two tiers, such as Big data enabled EnerGy-efficient vehIcular edge computing (BEGIN)  proposed a computing domain and a data domain whilst Software-Defined Vehicular Edge Computing (SD-VEC)  proposed a data plane and a control plane in their VEC architectures. The two layers can also be in the form of types of computing, cloud and edge computing layers .\nThe third layer of the VEC architecture involves with the cloud, such as core or central cloud , cloud computing ,  cloud-enabled control layer , regional cloud , public cloud , cloud server layer , remote cloud . The key advantage of the third layer is to provide an additional computational resources in the case of insufficient resources at edge nodes. Unlike others, the proposed VEC layers in  constitutes of three unique layers as seen in Table \\ref{type-layers}. \nSubsequently, the application layer , local authority , city-wide controller  or service provider is the fourth and also the last layer expanded in the VEC architecture. The entities in such layer deal with the Quality of Service (QoS), resource allocation  or reward policy . However, the bottleneck is the high overhead as the number of control messages, for instance, the amount of storage offered and computation time, may presence in the system. Regardless number of tiers in the VEC, interestingly for the scenario of vehicles social communication a layer related to the social edge computing  is introduced. The social relationships of vehicles are created based on their social interest and ties , preferences of content selection , or temporary storage of current contents or movies.\nApart from that, the enabler technology, such as big data , blockchain ,  Software-Defined Networks (SDN)  and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV)  are also incorporated in the VEC system.  The SDN and NFV bring new insights as their benefits can be in the functionalities presented in Table \\ref{sdn-table} and Table \\ref{nfv-table}, respectively. Typically, SDN is used to separate the control plane and data plane in serving VEC  and even to separate the control plane for cloud and fog servers . Since SDN stored the contextual information of vehicles , such as vehicle identification, location, speed, link, and contents in a database that resulted to an optimal offloading decision including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) paths and handover . With the information and optimal decision, the performance of a VEC system can then be predicted . In addition to that, the resource abstraction and slicing  as well as wireless access interworking  are handled by SDN. Therefore, SDN has a potential to improve the agility, reliability, scalability, and latency performance in VEC .\nOn the other hand, NFV primarily concentrates on the creation and configuration of virtual resources whereby the task is variably segmented dependent on the available virtual machine (VM) . Despite that, the spectrum slicing, load balancing and power control can also be administered by NFV . Therefore, NFV offers scalable virtual resources for scheduling different tasks in a timely manner. The connected edge server including the SDN/NFV controller offers important capabilities for identifying and selecting edge nodes, allocating and migrating tasks  and giving rewards to the AV that undertakes the residual workloads .\n\\begin{table*}[!h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{Functionalities of SDN in VEC}\n\t\\label{sdn-table}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \\hline\n\t\t\\textbf{Related

As shown in Table \\ref{types-fognodes}, the types of VENs considered in the offloading and caching works are cars, UAVs  or buses . The mobility of fog nodes explicitly expands new opportunities, such as on-demand computing where the moving vehicles may offer ubiquitously their available computational resources, particularly at the area without any SEN, like in rural areas.  Leveraging Parked Vehicles (PV)  at the parking area, for examples in the airport or shopping mall, as a primary VEN for computing and caching is also a promising solution for VEC.  Also, parked vehicles integrated with fog node controller as a data centre can expand the storage capacity for improving the performance of delivery services in vehicular networks.  However, the key limitation is that a cluster of parked cars cannot be fully used as supplemental resources when their power are turned off.  Although VEN has a small storage capacity compared with SEN, the vehicles are likely to offer a cheaper computational cost.  Another significant issue is that not all VENs including the PV are keen to offer their computational resources to other vehicles. To solve this, a good reputation VEN is necessary to receive a token or reward based on the acquired utility. \n\\begin{table*}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{VEC edge nodes}\n\t\\label{types-fognodes}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|L{8cm}|}\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\tCategories                            & Types of fog nodes                 & Related Works                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t\\multirow{4}{*}{Vehicular Fog Nodes}  & Vehicles                           &  \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& Parked Vehicles                    &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& Buses                              &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& UAVs                               &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t\\multirow{8}{*}{Stationary Edge Nodes} & BS                                 &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& RSU                                &                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& Wireless Access Router             &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& RSU with MEC/Fog server            &                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& RSU with VEC server                &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& RSU with VM server                 &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& BS with MEC server                 &                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\ \\cline{2-3} \n\t\t& RSU and BS connected to MEC server &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\ \\hline\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\nAnother important aspect, the term of cloudlet has been used to represent the coverage and connection of VENs and SENs, such as a bus-based cloudlet , a vehicle-based cloudlet , roadside cloudlet , cloudlet layer .

The communication technologies employed in VEC are broadly divided into vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) , vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)  or infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V)  and infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) . Specifically, wireless access in\nvehicular environments (WAVE) standard or also known as IEEE 802.11p  is an enabler for vehicles to communicate with other vehicles (i.e., V2V) on dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) frequency band . In the United States, out of  75 MHz of spectrum, seven 10-MHz are assigned for channels and 5-MHz is reserved as a guard band at the 5.9 GHz frequency band under DSRC applications . Besides that, the WAVE also supports multihop communication among vehicles. Despite DSRC, a feasible fronthaul link is assumed for the vehicle to communicate to the UAV as a fog node . For the parked vehicles in the building, wired Ethernet connection or available wireless hotspots can be used to establish the connections . Apparently, the benefits of wired setup are faster data upload and download speed, secure and reliable connectivity, but the cost of VEC implementation might increase.\nThe V2I or I2V is called for communication from vehicle to RSU/BS or vice versa. The enabler for the vehicle-to-RSU (V2RSU) can be based on IEEE 802.11p , IEEE 802.22 (TV whitespace) , wireless local area networks (WLAN) or WiFi . The IEEE 802.11 or often known as DSRC is exclusively defined to support emerging Intelligent Transport System (ITS) applications in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET). Thus, adopting other wireless alternatives, such as WLAN or cellular networks, are likely unable to address some delay-sensitive and location-dependent ITS applications. The key difference between WLAN and DSRC is that the WLAN users can only communicate with the access point after the association and authentication procedures, which required several seconds. In contrast, the exchange of data in DSRC can be performed without the association and authentication procedures. In other words, the vehicles can immediately send or receive data once they switch to the communication channel without waiting for the link establishment. Meanwhile, frequent interaction between vehicles and infrastructures using cellular networks may incur high payments for VEC customers. It seems that DSRC is the most appealing solution to support the intelligent transport system. \nApart from the RSU, the vehicle may offload to a BS under the category of infrastructure via cellular networks, WiMAX , Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) , Long-Term Evolution (LTE) LTE/4G , 5G . Due to the scalability and high efficiency, the author in  suggested to use 5G throughout the VEC communication from smart vehicles up to data centers. \nThe I2I communication is established between infrastructures, for example, RSU-BS, RSU-Cloud, BS-Cloud, can be either via cellular networks , 5G  or wired . Several works have assumed that the autonomous vehicles consist of multiple radio access networks interfaces , full-duplex radio  for connecting to edge nodes. Multi communication modules of vehicles may lead to robust and reliable connectivity, particularly during handover and beneficial in rural areas. Nevertheless, power consumption and the practicality for heterogeneous vehicular communication pose some challenges in VEC.\n\\begin{table*}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{Communication technologies for VEC}\n\t\\label{type-communication}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\n\t\t\\textbf{Communication protocols}  &\\textbf{Related Works} \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tDSRC &  \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tFull duplex radio &  \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tIEEE 802.22/TV White space & \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t5G & \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tOFDMA & \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tLTE/4G & \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tWireless LAN/WIFI/IEEE 802.11p & \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tWiMAX &  \\\\ \\hline\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [2919, 2917, 7118, 2918], "cite_extract_rate": 0.11764705882352941, "origin_cites_number": 34, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of communication technologies in VEC, listing protocols like DSRC, WLAN, 5G, and WiMAX.

In general, the vehicle manufacturer develops the CAs which include autonomous driving and safety support applications as the primary services initiated by the vehicles. Examples of autonomous driving applications are electronic stability control, automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, and for safety support applications are collision warning, signal violation warning, and emergency vehicles . HPAs are typically driving-related and optional safety-enhancing applications, such as high definition (HD) map , held-of view enhancement , location sight recognition  and road conditions . The high definition (HD) map encompasses the three-dimensional location of a roadmap (e.g., lane markings, signboards, crosswalks, barriers) .\nOn the other hand, LPAs are non-critical types of applications, such as infotainment , speech recognition , and video processing  to support a driver for instructing specific tasks. Despite the low bandwidth required for the CAs, low latency is mandatory to be fulfilled in mitigating road accidents and deaths. On the contrary, LPAs services may required high bandwidth and real-time, but the QoS is not as stringent as CAs. Therefore, it is vital for each service to be associated with its latency requirement, quality constraints, and workload profiles  either in a SDN or a fog controller/coordinator. \n\\begin{table*}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{Categories of vehicle applications}\n\t\\label{v-app}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{L{4cm}L{5cm}L{2cm}L{2cm}L{2cm}L{2cm}}\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\tCategories of Vehicle Applications &Examples   & Traffic Priority & Bandwidth &Latency \\\\ \\hline\n\t\tCritical Applications (CAs)         & autonomous driving, road-safety applications         & Highest   & Low    &Low          \\\\\n\t\tHigh-Priority Applications (HPAs)  & Image aided navigation, social-based application (i.e. intervehicle), parking navigation system, information services, traffic management,  optional safety applications & High    &Low to medium  & Low to medium     \\\\\n\t\tLow-Priority Applications (LPAs)   & Infotainment, multimedia, speech processing, passenger entertainment (interactive gaming) & Medium to Low  &Medium to High &Real-time       \\\\ \\hline\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\nTable ~\\ref{sum-app} summarises the types of traffic model attempted in the VEC offloading and downloading works.

However,  disagreed that the serving process at MEC servers is modeled as the \\textit{M/M/c} queuing model with \\textit{c} computation thread due to the Poisson distribution for the task arrival from the vehicle. The authors in  suggested a \\textit{G/M/c} model because the vehicular tasks follow a more general process rather than a Poisson distribution, which is evident in the results . \nThe works in  differ from others in terms of how they represent the vehicle applications. The authors in  assumed coded packets to be cached at vehicles for the resource allocation optimisation problem. The researchers in  dealt with a scheduling of electric vehicle energy demands via user datagram protocol-based calendars for both charging and discharging requests whereas  used time series analysis to model the content demands patterns subject to actual content request logs, which the model is called seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average.  On the other hand,  explored the fog computing under the assumption of social-based vehicular services such as Waze, Mooveit, SocialDrive, CaravanTrack, and GeoVanet, in Social Internet of vehicles (SOIV) . \nThus far, only little efforts  investigated various traffic in the offloading and catching works. While  considered delay-sensitive (i.e., safety-related packets) and delay-tolerant traffic (i.e. downloading HD map),  focused on HPAs (i.e.safety-related vehicular services) and LPAs. Besides that,  examined the elastic and inelastic groups of services. The elastic group is typically tolerant of latency and bandwidth that explicitly divides into two: traditional elastic services (e.g., data transmission) and interactive elastic services (e.g., online chatting). In contrast, the inelastic group that is defined for delay-sensitive services can also be divided into two: hard real-time services (e.g., Voice-over-Internet Protocol) and soft real-time services (e.g., Video over Demand or living streaming). All these four kinds of services are considerably explored by . On the contrary,  explored a hundred of vehicles concurrently run three types of applications, namely audio transcoder, face recognition and parking lot detection with the same deadline of 10-time slots, but different processing density level (i.e., 400, 2500 and 100000).\nAnswering what edge nodes appropriately served the vehicle applications, the vehicle must initially prioritise its applications, and itself serves the CPAs so that the latency is guaranteed unless insufficient computation arises. Meanwhile, HPAs may be offloaded to nearby VEN and SEN. The low-priority applications are likely to be computed by all edge nodes and even the core cloud platform. Note that offloading HPAs and LPAs to other edge nodes may only take place when the vehicle undergoes insufficient computational resources.

On the other hand, considerable VEC offloading works assumed deploying the server at the RSU (see Table \\ref{types-fognodes}) besides the BS. Another primary different is various kind of vehicles with specific mobility are used as edge nodes instead of mobile devices, which owing to a fast fading channel that affects the VEC performance. In terms of the communication protocol, DSRC is mostly used for the V2I communication for the case of RSU as edge nodes. Nevertheless, other cellular networks as highlighted previously are also evaluated in the VEC works. In VEC, the requesting vehicles are surrounded by several edge nodes (i.e., SEN and VEN) for the offloading decision. Identifying a reliable edge node for consistent connectivity is a big challenge because of the vehicle speed. Therefore, the edge nodes are currently characterised and selected in terms of available workload, central processing unit (CPU) processing rate, energy consumption, radio transmission rate, offloading cost, security and reputations. \nSince the requesting vehicle contains tempospatial data; unlike mobile cellular networks, another concern is how to optimally execute the offloading includes types of data whether segmented or not from the vehicle. Furthermore, optimum task allocation on the computational resources of edge nodes is essential to satisfy the stringent latency. Under the assumption of vehicles with multi-communication interfaces, a decision on what radio access networks is also an important problem, but thus far limited work highlighted this. From the perspective of VEN, the underutilised ones inevitably can serve many vehicles within their boundaries, but at certain extent a high density of vehicles, particularly at the road segments or junctions, can substantially serve as edge nodes and probably has high offloading requirement. The small segments within a region or small cloudlets may reduce the offloading complexity.

Figure \\ref{fig:offload} illustrates the data computation offloading scenario for non-high dense and high dense networks. Typically, the vehicles send the data to the core cloud that results in a significant delay. Considering several constraints such as the deadline, quality loss, transmission rate, energy efficiency, and fog capacity, the process of task allocation across VENs and SENs is formulated into an optimization problem, which is known as a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem  or mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) . The latency can be calculated based on transmission time including the round trip time between the requesting vehicle and the edge node, queuing and processing times at edge node  and also handover time for the inter-offloading scenario . The existing optimisation schemes in VEC broadly emphasised several elements, such as QoS, energy, monetary, and security. Table \\ref{rm-summary} summarises the characteristics of the existing offloading optimisation schemes in VEC.

Based on task similarity and task computing, the former classified the vehicles into two kinds of sub-cloudlets respectively, which were task offloading subcloudlet and task computing subcloudlet. Then, the later stage used the graph theory and maximum weight independent set for a two-sided matching process between the requesting vehicles and edge nodes by minimising the service latency and balancing the load of heterogeneous edge nodes. However, the results demonstrated high latency when there is a small number of resource-rich vehicles in the networks. Meanwhile,  suggested an adaptive volatile upper confidence bound algorithm with load-awareness and occurrence-awareness where the utility function with regards to the classic multi-armed bandit is designed for V2V. The work is then extended by presenting an adaptive learning-based task offloading algorithm in minimising the average offloading delay . The algorithm improved the average delay between 10\\% and 13\\% compared with the former algorithm, but the scenario is only a single requesting vehicle. Another delay optimisation problem presented a pricing-based one-to-one matching and one-to-many matching algorithms for task offloading primarily at an RSU subject to minimise the total network delay . The advantage is that the algorithm is validated based on three different road conditions, which are straight road, urban road with a traffic light, and winding road extracted from the realistic road topologies of Beijing and Guangdong, China. Interestingly, the lowest average delay is achieved when the offloading presents on the straight road. \nOn the other hand,  minimised the response time for each time slot using some steps based on brand-and-bound and Edmonds-Karp algorithms. The message response time is the summation of the response time of cloudlet, the response time of parked vehicles and response time of moving vehicles as well as the delay caused by incoming messages . The key advantage of the work is that the offloading is performed at both moving and parked vehicles. The findings demonstrated that the average response time achieved less than 1s with the increase of message arrival rates in Shanghai and considerably dropped when the total number of parked vehicle-based edge nodes raises. Similarly,  devised the task scheduling optimisation problem by minimising the average response time of computation based on a modified genetic algorithm where integer coding was used. One major drawback of both works  is that the mobility analysis is not conducted. Whereas,  devised the computation offloading problem subject to minimise the computation overhead based on game theory, i.e., a strategic game, and was able to achieve Nash Equilibrium. The offloading problem also can be solved using total utility jobs completed at instantaneous time, and an Autonomous Vehicular Edge framework  is proposed that comprises of four main phases, namely, job caching, discovery, ant-colony optimisation-based scheduling and data transmission. The limitation of the work is that a high computation required.\nComparing with others, the computation offloading problem can be solved also based on the longest lifetime of V2V routing path and a recovery of a broken V2V path using LifeTime-based Network State Routing and LifeTime-based Path Recovery algorithms, respectively . The results demonstrated that the average lifetime of V2V paths increased with low mobility vehicles due to stable connections.

The strength of the proposed scheme is that the transmission mode is adaptive with vehicle speeds; however, the vehicle hops may cause some delay. The results demonstrated that the mobile-edge computing servers reduced the cost of computational resources and transmission besides fast response time compared with direct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), i.e., RSU with multihops backhaul RSU relay. \nConsidering the minimisation of the predicted cost of the load and also the load distribution among MEC servers, a load-aware MEC offloading method called as Load-Aware Mode is proposed . It is seen that the proposed scheme can reduce up to 65\\% of total cost and achieve approximately 100\\% of the task success ratio. A mobility-aware and a location-based task offloading are introduced in  based on Newton-Raphson methods by minimising the completed system cost includes the communication and computation costs of the required vehicle while satisfying the task latency. Numerical results showed that the proposed schemes can reduce the system costs approximately 50\\% from other techniques, and the latency constraint was satisfied. However, both works  overlook the types of vehicle applications that can be investigated.\nExploring a machine learning technique, specifically deep reinforcement learning  can solve the offloading problem by minimising the expected cumulative discounted reward (i.e., task execution delay) for multi-task services. The advantage of the work is that dynamic VEC environment is studied, but the results are not explicitly discussed.\n\\begin{table*}[!htb]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{Single optimisation schemes in VEC}\n\t\\label{so}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{|C{1.5cm}|C{2cm}|L{3cm}|L{3cm}|L{3cm}|L{3cm}|}\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t{\\bf Related Works}\t&{\\bf Optimisation Type} &{\\bf Optimisation Utility}  &{\\bf Optimsiation Techniques} &{\\bf Advantages}  &{\\bf Disadvatages}  \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t &Optimal &Minimise service latency &two-sided matching algorithm &Load balancing & High latency when small number of resource-rich vehicles\\\\ \\hline\n\t\t &Suboptimal &Minimise average offloading delay &multi-armed bandit (MAB) & Input data size and occurrence of vehicles alert & Only a single requesting vehicle \\\\ \\hline  \t   \t\n\t\t &Optimal &Minimise total offloading delay &One-to-one and one-to-many matching & Three different mobility model and road conditions &No partial offloading at local vehicle \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t &Optimal & Minimise computation overhead & Game theory (i.e., strategic game)  &Computation overhead & No QoS delay and mobility \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t    & Near-optimal     & Maximise total utility of jobs completed    & Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) and a brute-force method   & Successful offloading  &High computation time  \\\\  \\hline\n\t\t &Optimal &Maximum lifetime-based routing and path recovery & path routing &V2V path broken (e.g. vehicle run away) &No latency analysis and mobility \\\\ \\hline\t  \t\n\t\t &Optimal &Minimise average response time of computing &Modified genetic algorithm and statistical priority & Mutual dependent tasks & No mobility analysis\\\\ \\hline\n\t\t &Optimal &Minimise message response time  & brand-and-bound algorithm, Edmond Karps-algorithm & Offloading to both moving and parked vehicles & No mobility analysis \\\\ \\hline  \t\n\t\t\\multirow{3}{3cm}{} & \\multirow{3}{*}{Optimal}                   & \\multirow{3}{3cm}{Minimise energy consumption for offloading }  & Sequential task graph       \\\\ \\cline{4-4}                  \n\t\t&                                            &                                                                                                                       & Exhaustive Method   \\\\ \\cline{4-4}   \n\t\t&\n\t\t&                                                                                                  & Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP)  and value iteration algorithm     & Multi-cloudlet and high mobility & Application completion time is uncertain \\\\ \\hline                                           \n\t\t &Optimal &Minimise user's energy consumption for offloading &Dynamic programming & Vehicle fog node serves multiple tasks or vehicles & No specific applications and mobility  \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t &optimal &Minimise the cost of offloading & Load-aware mode (LAM) &Multi vehicular MEC networks &No specific application and delay performance \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t &Suboptimal &Minimise system costs (communication and computation) &Convex problem solved using  Newton-Raphson &Mobility and cooperation between MEC servers &No specific applications\\\\ \\hline\n\t\t    & Optimal  & Minimise offloading cost of both data transmission and task computation resources     & Game theory with one mixed strategies & Local and fog computing, adaptive transmission mode & Number of offloading hops may cause significant delay            \\\\ \\hline\n\t\t &Optimal & Minimise expected cumulative discounted reward & Deep reinforcement learning & Dynamic VEC environment state &No mobility\\\\ \\hline \t\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [2917, 2916, 2915], "cite_extract_rate": 0.1111111111111111, "origin_cites_number": 27, "insight_result": {"type": "comparative", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section organizes and compares various price-based optimization approaches in VEC, using a table to summarize key characteristics and trade-offs.

The computation is based on previous experience with the targeted vehicles, recommendations from the neighbouring vehicles and also from a central authority. A bargaining game is formulated for the service provider to consider the vehicle reputation value in the bargaining power and also the required task allocation, which is known as reputation-assisted optimisation. A vehicle with high reputation is given high priority to determine its required resources resulted in high user satisfaction. Despite that, the exchange of reputation messages between vehicles and VEC server might lead to a high overhead in the networks. Another similar work  demonstrated data security and load balancing for the proposed 5G-enabled Intelligent Transport System (ITS) framework. It integrated the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), dispatcher, edge nodes, and aggregator to maximize the processing capabilities, minimize delay, and maximize the security of the ITS. With the Bloom-filter-based security protocol used in the proposed framework, the delay can be reduced by increasing the number of edge nodes and transmitting UAV. One concern with the emergence of UAVs as edge nodes is on the battery lifetime for handling the data.   \n\\begin{table*}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{Hybrid Optimisation in

When the vehicle drives into a new city, the driver possibly acquires some spatial information on the attraction places, road conditions, live traffic, favorite restaurants or available parking spaces i.e., location-centric. Meanwhile, infotainment services like video or games may be requested by the vehicle passengers and can be analysed in terms of the users' demographics, i.e., user-centric. Information regarding the vehicles, for instance car safety, road tax, and car service or built-in sensors also can be cached at specific storage. Relaxing the burden of cloud computing, some data, such as location-centric and user-centric, can be cached locally via RSUs, vehicles or edge servers and timely shared with other vehicles, as depicted in Figure \\ref{fig:download}. With the advent of IoV  and VSNs  have led to the V2V caching and communications become a reality. Caching mobile contents at the edge of networks may reduce the backhaul congestion and achieve the peak traffic apart from the lower latency . Nevertheless, the high variability in vehicular connectivity and rapid changes of the vehicular network topology pose some challenges on data safety and accuracy. \nIn retrieving the vehicular contents, the Information-Centric Networking (ICN)  used the content name despite the IP address of the caching node and is prominently applied in the vehicular networks. It brings certain benefits, such as reducing the response time and the overwhelming access on the content provider. In addition to that, the key feature of the ICN is to store the most popular contents as a priority. \nTable \\ref{sum-datacaching} summarises the characteristics of data caching and dissemination approaches in VEC. For convenience,the data caching and dissemination approaches are classified into two, which are homogeneous cache and heterogeneous cache.

With CCN, the vehicles only request the name of the required content from the parked vehicles without additional overhead and the process of content interest sending, content distribution, and content replacement is detailed in . The proposed technique considerably achieved a high number of successful content transmission and the shortest download delay, but required a high algorithm complexity. Another similar work employed a group of the content-centric unit (CCU) to work with vehicles and RSUs in the proposed Content-Centric Vehicular Networks framework . The CCU can serve one or multiple RSUs, and even one RSU can be attached to several CCUs. The priority for the contents storage is subject to the request time, the arrival rate of vehicles, and the request content distribution, i.e., Zipf, which is likely can cause high overheads for the information.  However, referring to the information the lowest priority of content can be appropriately removed. A replica of required content in a selective nearby CCU was delivered to vehicle via RSU.\n\\begin{figure*}[htp]\n\t\\center{\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]\t{figures/blockchain.png}}\n\t\\caption{Secure data storage and sharing using blockchain in VEC }\n\t\\label{fig:blockchain}\n\\end{figure*}\nFollowing the recent blockchain technology, Figure \\ref{fig:blockchain} shows a secure data storage and sharing using blockchain in VEC . Smart contracts on the vehicular blockchain were proposed for a secure RSU data, and a reputation-based data sharing among vehicles called a three-weight subjective logic model for selecting the most reliable data source. The vehicle coin, which is a specific crypto-currency for vehicular edge computing and networks, is rewarded as incentives to the edge nodes in three kinds of cases: resource storage contribution, new data block update, and data providers. A local controller as seen in the figure records the total amount of contributed data storage of edgde nodes. The edge nodes (i.e., RSUs) as data aggregators periodically integrates raw data received into a data block, and requests verification from other edge nodes by broadcasting the data block.\nNevertheless, the proposed blockchain-based method will be more pervasive if QoS is taken into consideration, as in . Exploring a different mechanism, an edge-based data dissemination protocol was developed for traffic safety messages from RSUs to vehicles, and the protocol was integrated with a route request (RREQ) message and a route reply (RREP) message for delay-tolerant applications . The farthest vehicles were scheduled on the earliest timeslot for the minimal delay, similar to . If the vehicle received a duplicate of the messages, the message broadcasting was then terminated to minimise the overheads.", "cites": [2920], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes several technologies (content-centric networking, blockchain, and message protocols) for content caching and delivery in VEC, connecting them to vehicular use cases and edge node configurations.

The edge cloud sent a service request to the BS, which was aware of vehicular channel conditions, and hence the BS transmitted the request to the vehicle for data processing. However, a poor performance was observed for the case of high mobility cooperation.  Another caching solution introduced the utility function to maximise the hit ratio using a cross-entropy based dynamic content caching algorithm . The requested vehicles can fetch the content from several candidates, which are other moving vehicles, RSU, or the remote content server accordingly with regards that the average delay is well-kept. With the consideration of content popularity, content size, and also content cache capacity of the vehicle and RSU, the proposed technique achieved the highest hit ratio, the lowest relative delay, and overhead. Another work on a cost-effective resource sharing under a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization problem was developed to minimise the cost of video service provider's in IoV . The target user received the video prior to the VSP optimally retrieved the video either from the moving vehicle or cloud. An incentive mechanism was introduced to encourage the vehicle sharing its contents with the BS. With a massive number of vehicles on the road, a multihop vehicle-to-vehicle connection can be performed instead of multihop backhaul relay. Apart from that,  demonstrated that the VSP's cost was exponentially decreasing with the vehicle user's speed between 50 to 120 km/h. This is because the low speed VUs can sufficiently fetch the data from other vehicles within the delay constraint while the fast vehicle has a limited BS streaming process. However, both works in  have a drawback in terms of high algorithm complexity and computation.\n\\begin{table*}[!htb]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{Content Caching and Delivery Approaches in
