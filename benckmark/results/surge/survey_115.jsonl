When walking down the street and going from one location to the other, tends to be easy for a human to identify where s/he is located. During the past years, deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have outperformed traditional methods in many classification tasks. These models have shown to achieve high classification performance when large and variety datasets are available for training. Nowadays, the available visual data is not only presented in a static format, as an image, but also in a dynamic format, as video recordings. The analysis of videos adds an additional level of complexity since the inherent temporal aspect of video recordings must be considered: a video can capture scenes which suffer temporal alterations. Scene recognition with deep learning has been addressed by ensemble techniques that combine different levels of semantics extracted from the images, e.g. recognized objects, global information, and context at different scales.  \nDeveloping robust and reliable models for the automatic recognition of scenes is of importance in the field of intelligent systems and artificial intelligence since it directly supports real-life applications. For instance, \\textit{Scene and event recognition} has been previously addressed in the literature . \\textit{Scene recognition for robot localization} with indoor localization for mobile robots is one of the emerging application scopes of scene recognition . According to the authors of , in the following two decades, every household could own a social robot employed for housekeeping, surveillance or companionship tasks. In the field of lifelogging, collections of photo-sequences have proven to be a rich tool for the understanding of the behaviour of people. In  methods were develop for the analysis of egocentric image collected by wearable cameras. The above-mentioned approaches address the recognition of scenes either following  an image-based approach or a video or photo-sequence based approach.\nAs contributions, (i) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that collects works that address the task of scene recognition with deep deep learning from visual data, both from images and videos.

Thus, deep learning CNNs are applied to tackle the complexity and high variance of the task of scene recognition. \nThe inherent difficulty of scene recognition is related to the nature of the images depicting a scene context. Two major challenges were described in : \n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Visual inconsistency} refers to low inter-class variance. Some scene categories can share similar visual appearances which create the issue of class overlaps. Since images belonging to two different classes can be easily confused with one another, the class overlap cannot be neglected. \n    \\item \\textit{Annotation ambiguity} describes a high intra-class variance of scene categories. Demarcation of the categories is a subjective process which is highly dependent on the experience of the annotators, therefore images from the same category can showcase significant differences in appearance.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe majority of the available datasets are focused on object categories providing labels , bounding boxes  or segmentations . ImageNet , COCO (Common Objects in Context), and Open Images  are well known in the field of object recognition. Even though these dataset were  built for object recognition, transfer learning has shown to be an effective approach when aiming to apply them for scene recognition. \n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n \\caption{Example of samples of the publicly available datasets as described in Table \\ref{tab1}.

Several annotators were asked to label every image and images with contradicting labels were discarded. Currently, the dataset is available in the Places365-standard format (i.e. 365 categories, roughly 1 million images training set, validation set with 50 images per class and test with 900 images per class) and the Places365-challenge format which extends the training set to 8 million image samples in total. With a dataset of this magnitude, the training of CNNs exclusively on data describing scenes becomes feasible.\n\\begin{table}[]\n\\caption{An overview of publicly available datasets for the task of scene recognition.}\n\\label{tab1}\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!} {\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Dataset}  &  \\multirow{2}{*}{Data}  & \\multirow{2}{*}{ \\#Classes } &  \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{ Classification of } & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{ Labelled as }  \\\\\n& & & \\ Images \\ & \\ Streams \\ & \\ Object \\ & \\ Scenes   \\\\ \\hline\nPlaces365  & 1M images & 365 &\\checkmark & & &\\checkmark \\\\\nMIT Indoor67  & 15620 images & 67 &\\checkmark & & &\\checkmark  \\\\\nSUN397  & 108754 images & 397 &\\checkmark & & &\\checkmark \\\\\n15 scene  & 4000 images & 15 &\\checkmark & & &\\checkmark  \\\\ \\hline\nMaryland `in-the-wild'  & 10 videos & 13 & &\\checkmark & &\\checkmark  \\\\\nYUPENN  & 410 videos & 14 & &\\checkmark & &\\checkmark  \\\\\nYUP++  & 1200 videos & 20 & & \\checkmark& &\\checkmark  \\\\ \\hline\nImagenet  & 3.2M images & 1000 &\\checkmark & &\\checkmark & \\\\\nCOCO  & 1.5M images & 80 & \\checkmark& &\\checkmark &  \\\\\nOpen Images  & 1.7M images & 600 &\\checkmark & &\\checkmark &  \n\\end{tabular}}\n\\end{table}\nScene recognition also encloses dynamic scene data; due to the limited amount of available datasets which include such data, most of the research efforts in this sub-field also include gathering suitable experimental data. Here we highlight the Maryland `in-the-wild' , YUPENN  , YUP++  datasets. The dataset in  poses new challenges by introducing more complex data, i.e. videos with camera motion. The scope of the categories that are being recorded amongst the three datasets presented is not nearly as exhaustive as in the case of the objects and scenes datasets mentioned above. This is an indicator of the incipient status of research in this particular area of scene recognition.\nThe original models proposed by the authors of the  and  datasets were not based on deep learning techniques. The authors of the the Maryland `in-the-wild' , introduced a chaotic system framework for describing the videos. The authors' proposed pipeline extracts a 960-dimensional Gist descriptor per videoframe. Each dimension is considered a time-series, from which the chaotic invariants are computed. Traditional classifiers, such as KNN and SVM, are used for the final classification. In , the authors introduced the YUPENN dataset and for its analysis, they proposed a spatiotemporal oriented energy feature representation of the videos which they classify using KNN.\nAn overview of the described datasets is provided in Table \\ref{tab1}.

The approach proposed by the authors of literature  is to exploit the vast dataset at hand by training three popular CNNs architectures (i.e. AlexNet , GoogLeNet , VGG16 ) on the Places dataset. The performance of these architectures over the validation and test splits of the Places365 dataset are presented in Table \\ref{tab:original_performance_places365}. When introducing a new dataset, it became a ritual to test the generalization capabilities of weights trained over Places365. Thus, authors fine-tune these specialised networks trained on Places365 over newly available datasets. For instance, the VGG16, pre-trained on the Places365 dataset, achieved a 92.99\\% accuracy on the SUN Attribute dataset . To compare the performance of the above approaches for static scene recognition, the following datasets are considered: 15 scenes dataset , MIT Indoor 67  and SUN 397 . An overview of the comparison of the quantitative results is presented in Table \\ref{tab:res_overview}.\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{An overview of the quantitative comparison in terms of accuracy between methods for single image classification for the 15 scenes, MIT Indoor, SUN 397 datasets.} \n\\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{l| c| c| c}\n    & 15 scenes & MIT Indoor & SUN 397  \\\\\n    \\hline \n    Places365 AlexNet & 89.25\\% & 70.72\\% & 56.12\\%   \\\\\n    Places365 GoogleNet & 91.25\\%  & 73.20\\%  & 58.37\\%   \\\\\n    Places365 VGG & 91.97\\%  & 76.53\\%  & \\textbf{63.24\\%}   \\\\\n    Hybrid1365 VGG  & \\textbf{92.15\\%}  & \\textbf{79.49\\%}  & 61.77\\%   \\\\\n    7-scale Hybrid VGG  & \\textbf{94.08\\%}  & 80.22\\% \\iffalse (w/ FT) \\fi  & 63.19\\%*   \\\\\n    7-scale Hybrid AlexNet  & 93.90\\%  & \\textbf{80.97\\%} \\iffalse (w/ FT) \\fi  & \\textbf{65.38\\%}   \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\label{tab:res_overview}\n\\end{table}\nFurthermore, in  the authors experimented with the ResNet152 residual network architecture, fine-tuned over the Places365. This work achieved a top-5 accuracy of 85.08\\% and 85.07\\% on the validation and, respectively, the test set of the Places365 dataset, as shown in Table \\ref{tab:original_performance_places365}.\nThe use of the semantic and contextual composition of the image has been proposed by various approaches. For instance, in , the authors proposed the Hybrid1365 VGG architecture, a combination of deep learning techniques trained for object and scene recognition. The method uses different scales at which objects appear in a scene can facilitate the classification process by targeting distinct regions of interest within the image. Objects usually appear at lower scales. Therefore, the object classifier should target local scopes of the image. In contrast, the scene classifier should be aimed at the global scale, in order to capture contextual information. They concluded that it is possible to extend the performance obtained individually by each method. The Hybrid1365 VGG architecture  scores the highest average accuracy of 81.48\\% over all the experiments conducted for the place-centric CNN approach (has the highest performance for 2 out of 3 comparison datasets as shown in Table \\ref{tab:res_overview}).\nThe dataset biases which arise under different scaling conditions of the images is addressed in , by involving a multi-scale model which combines various CNNs specialized either on object or place knowledge. The authors combined the training data available in the Places and ImageNet datasets. The knowledge learned from the two datasets is coupled in a scale-adaptive way. In order to aggregate the extracted features over the architectures used, simple max pooling\\footnote{Max pooling is a pooling operation which computes the maximum value in each patch of a feature map; it is employed for down-sampling input representations.} is adopted in order to down-sample the feature space. If the scaling operation is significant, the features of the data can drastically change from describing scene data to object data. The architectures are employed to extract features in parallel from patches, which represent the input image at increasingly larger scale versions. The multi-scale model combines several AlexNet architectures . The hybrid multi-scale architecture uses distinctive models for different scale ranges; depending on the scale range, the most suitable model is chosen from object-centric CNN (pre-trained on ImageNet), scene-centric CNN (pre-trained on Places365) or a fine-tuned CNN (adapted to the corresponding scale based on the dataset at hand). In total, seven scales were considered; the scales were obtained by scaling the original images between $227\\times227$ and $1827\\times1827$ pixels. For the final classification given by the multi-scale hybrid approach, the concatenation of the fc7 features (i.e. features extracted by the 7th fully connected layer of the CNN) from the seven networks are considered. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the feature space. This model obtained the highest accuracy of 95.18\\% on the 15 scenes dataset .\nThe hybrid approaches presented in  and  achieve higher accuracy than a human expert, which was quantified as 70.60\\%. This indicates that the combination of object-centric and scene-centric knowledge can potentially establish a new performance standard for scene recognition.\n\\begin{comment}\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{images/scene_obj_scale.png}\n    \\caption{Multi-scale hybrid architecture combining scale-specific networks as proposed by .

CNNs have shown promising results for the general task of scene recognition in single images and have the potential to be also generalized to video data. To achieve this generalization, the spatio-temporal nature of dynamic scenes must be considered. While static scenes (depicted as single images) only present spatial features, videos also capture temporal transformations which affect the spatial aspect of the scene. Therefore, one challenge related to the task of scene classification from videos is creating a model which is powerful enough to capture both the spatial and temporal information of the scene. However, there are few works on video analysis for scene recognition. \nIn the works introduced in , the authors relied on Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for video description. However, they did not focus on recognizing the scenes. \n\\begin{table}[h!]\n    \\caption{Overview of the results achieved by the spatio-temporal residual network (T-ResNet) proposed in  over the YUP++ dataset.}\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{l | c| c |c}\n         & YUP++ static & YUP++ moving & YUP++ complete \\\\\n         \\hline  \n        ResNet & 86.50\\% & 73.50\\% & 85.90\\% \\\\\n        T-ResNet & \\textbf{92.41\\%} & \\textbf{81.50\\%} & \\textbf{89.00\\%}\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\label{tab:results_dynamic}\n\\end{table}\nIn , the authors introduced the T-ResNet architecture, alongside the YUP++  dataset, which established a new benchmark in the sub-field of dynamic scene recognition. The T-ResNet is based on a residual network  that was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset . It employs transfer learning to adapt the spatial-centric residual architecture to a spatio-temporal-centric network. The results achieved by the architecture were only compared with the classical ResNet architecture as shown in Table \\ref{tab:results_dynamic}. \nThe superiority of the T-ResNet is evident: it achieves an accuracy of 92.41\\% on the YUP++ static camera partition, 81.50\\% on the YUP++ moving camera partition and finally 89.00\\% on the entire YUP++ dataset. This demonstrates the superiority of the spatio-temporal approach. The T-ResNet model exhibits strong performance for classes with linear motion patterns, e.g. classes `elevator', `ocean', `windmill farm'. However, for scene categories presenting irregular or mixed defining motion patterns the performance is negatively impacted, e.g. classes `snowing' and `fireworks'. The authors of  observed that T-ResNet exhibits difficulties distinguishing intrinsic scene dynamics from the additional motion of the camera. Further research is required to account for this difference.\n\\begin{comment}\nSince they test their network on action recognition, we can exclude it from this analysis\nThe authors of  conducted experiments to analyse the generalization ability of the proposed network on action recognition tasks. For the challenge of action recognition, optical flow is a discriminative feature.

The combination of scene-centric and object-centric knowledge has proven superior to only considering the scene context. Dynamic scene recognition reached new state-of-the-art performance through the approach of adapting spatial networks to the task, transforming the network to also consider the temporal aspect of the scenes. These emerging spatio-temporal networks are suitable for video data captured with a static camera. However, it still faces difficulties in the case of added camera motion.\nOne observation arising from methods addressing single image analysis scene recognition is that deeper CNN architectures such as GoogLeNet  or VGG  are not superior in all cases. For the hybrid multi-scale model combining scene-centric and object-centric networks in , experiments using VGG architecture for more than two-scales (two VGG networks) obtained disappointing results, inferior to the baseline performance achieved with one single scale (one network). Since the multi-scale hybrid model entails seven different scales, it can be inferred that VGG becomes noisy when applied on small input image patches.\nAddressing the task of scene recognition from the global features that describe an image, the CNNs are expected to learn deep features that are relevant for the contextual clues present in the image. Literature  observers that the low-level convolutional layers detect low-level visual concepts such as object edges and textures, while the high-level layers activate on entire objects and scene parts. Even though the model has been previously trained on an exclusively places-centric dataset, the network still identifies semantic clues in the image by detecting objects alongside contextual clues. Therefore, CNNs trained on the Places Database (which does not contain object labels) could still be employed for object detection. \nAnother aspect arising from training the same architecture on datasets with a different number of scene categories (i.e. and Places365) proves that having more categories leads to better results as well as more predicted categories. We can observe that the architecture AlexNet trained on Places205 (version prior to Places365) obtains 57.2\\% accuracy, while the same architecture trained on Places365 obtains 57.7\\% accuracy. For the places CNN approach two main types of miss-classifications occur: on one hand, less-typical activities happening in a scene context (e.g. taking a photo at a construction site) and on the other hand, images depicting multiple scene parts. A possible solution, as proposed by , would be assigned multiple ground-truth labels in order to capture the content of an image more precisely.\nThe results achieved by the T-ResNet model illustrate the potential of spatio-temporal networks for video analysis. The transformation from a purely spatial network to a spatio-temporal one can succeed on the basis of a very small training set (i.e. only 10\\% of the YUP++ dataset introduced) as proven by . Well-initialized spatial networks can be efficiently transformed to extract spatio-temporal features, therefore, in theory, most networks that perform well on single image analysis could be easily adapted to video analysis.", "cites": [514, 305, 4585], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.8, "critical": 3.2, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple cited papers to discuss key trends in scene recognition, such as the effectiveness of combining scene and object-centric knowledge and the limitations of deeper CNNs in multi-scale settings.
