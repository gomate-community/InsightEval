Among other purposes, DNS is used today widely for domain names to translate them into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The domain name system maps a name that people use to locate a website to the IP address that a computer uses to locate that website. For example, if a user types www.example.com into a web browser, a server behind the scenes will map that name to an IP address, e.g., {1.2.3.4}, corresponding to that domain. Web browsing and most other Internet activities, e.g., transferring files, rely on DNS to quickly provide the information necessary to connect users to remote hosts. DNS mapping is distributed throughout the Internet in a hierarchy of authorities. \nBased on the key role of the DNS in networking infrastructure, attackers are aggressively looking for new ways to compromise the DNS infrastructure. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the evolution of DNS security and the associated issues to preserve reliable and secure services, and to improve the security of DNS through various iterations of design revisions. Indeed, recently, researchers from academia and industry have focused on improving the design of DNS by allowing various necessary options, and by revising its assumptions of operation. However, the constant evolution of DNS, as well as the rise of new detrimental and unconventional issues, such as pervasive adversaries, privacy risks, and new and advanced forms of attacks, make the functionality, security, and privacy of DNS important issues that require continued attention and investigation. To this end, surveying, summarizing, and categorizing the body of work on DNS security and privacy is an  important endeavor that is lacking in the existing literature. This effort is necessary to guide the community to what is an open problem that requires further attention. \nParticularly, despite the large number of works in the literature on DNS security and privacy, existing contributions are scattered across different research areas and a comprehensive yet concise survey is lacking. Although there exist several surveys in the field of DNS~, they are limited from several points of view. First, the scope of those works is narrow, e.g., covering only a certain aspect of the DNS ecosystem, such as detecting Internet abuse by analyzing passive DNS traffic~, malicious domain detection through DNS data analysis~, and investigating the domain name squatting ecosystem~. Second, the number of studies covered in each of those prior works---even on the very well accepted set of problems in the field of DNS security and privacy---is limited, and does not cover the most recent advances, which require further attention and consideration---especially in an evolving domain~. \n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{fig/SurveyOutline.pdf}\n  \\caption{The general outline of the survey.

Toward this goal, we have surveyed a wide range of research works from various points of view, including the DNS threat landscape, DNS research methods, and DNS research scopes. \nThe general outline of the survey, highlighting the road map towards the key terms and directions, is shown in \\autoref{fig:SurveyOutline}.

By reviewing the threats, we primarily focus on the common challenges in security and privacy of DNS infrastructure. Such threats may not only compromise the security and privacy of end-users, but may also undermine the performance and availability of Internet services that heavily rely on DNS for their operation. We demonstrate such an interdependence through various practical and challenging attacks and efforts in the literature to defend against them. For example, attackers abuse the functionality of open DNS resolvers to transfer a small number of DNS queries into significantly large payload coordinated at a target server or network, thus making the server inaccessible, in what is known as amplification attacks. Despite the large body of research works on detection and mitigation of \\textit{DNS amplification attacks}~, such attacks still compromise today's Internet, according to \\textit{Nexusguard's} 2018 threat report of Q1~. \nAnother example we highlight is cache poisoning; DNS resolver cache can be compromised through the insertion of unauthorized domain names and IP addresses in order to redirect users to malicious IP addresses. Consequently, by launching this attack an adversary can compromise the performance of Internet services and distribute malicious contents, such as malware, spam, credentials theft, phishing contents, among many others. There exist several research works that attempted to address \\textit{DNS cache poisoning attacks}~ using different methods, such as DNSSEC~, WSEC DNS~, ECO-DNS~, and Anax~, among others, which we outline this study.\nAttackers also utilize \\textit{botnets} that allow them to access devices through propagation and coordinate among them using C\\&C channels to perform wide variety of malicious activities, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack~, amplification attacks, and credentials stealing,  among many others~. DNS plays an essential role in the operation of botnets by providing easily deploy-able C\\&C channel. Although various research works have studied botnets and possible solutions to defend against their attacks~, including marginalizing DNS infrastructure used for this attack. However, such attacks are still on the rise, compromising users' security. Specifically, the emergence and rise of IoT and associated vulnerabilities opened new directions, whereby attack vectors facilitated by DNS' reliability and deployment played a crucial role in those attacks. For example, the Mirai botnet attacks  IoT devices, such as routers and video recorders~, and uses them for amplification attacks, necessitating  security solutions optimized for IoT and its interplay with DNS~. \n\\textit{DNS manipulation} may expose users to multiple threats, such as phishing and malicious domains. Accordingly, a large number of studies considered DNS manipulation~, and its interplay with the detection and mitigation of \\textit{phishing attacks}~. Despite this large number of studies, phishing and associated DNS manipulation is still a challenging and expanding area.  Phishers are targeting mobile messaging and social apps at an increasing rate~, highlighting the need for further investigation and defenses. \nA large body of research has been devoted to the detection of \\textit{malicious domain names}~, which can be classified into two general categories: classification based~ and inference based~ methods. Classification-based methods rely on local network and host information. The inference-based methods exploit global information along with local information of domains. \nDomain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are utilized to intermittently produce a large number of domain names for malicious purposes. There exist several research works that explored the ecosystem of DGAs~. \nFurthermore, another type of threat is \\textit{domain name squatting}, where cybersquatters register variants of popular trademark names through different squatting strategies, has been considered. Such attacks include various variants, i.e. typosquatting~, bitsquatting~, combosquatting~, and soundsquatting~. Domain name squatting becomes popular as an attack vector to start many other types of attacks~. Related to this is domain monetization through parking; despite technically being a legitimate business, \\textit{parked domain monetization} can often lead to and get mixed with other practices, i.e. click fraud, as well as traffic spam and traffic stealing---which usually lead to serving  malicious content i.e. malware and  spam~. All of these threats may compromise the security and privacy of DNS landscape and users. There are large amount of research regarding \\textit{privacy leakage} and various solutions have been proposed, such as  EncDNS~, PPDNS~, DLV~, \\etc However, \n\\BfPara{DNS Research Methods} Another vertical of our survey is the DNS research methods used in the literature, and their associated work. In exploring the DNS research methods, we have investigated various data analysis methods, which have been utilized to detect, model, and mitigate the aforementioned DNS threats. First, we describe two main \\textit{DNS data collection methods} utilized in the literature and the associated works, including \\textit{passive DNS data (PDNS)}~ and \\textit{Active DNS data (ADNS)}~.  Next, we categorize the research works based on the common \\textit{DNS data analysis techniques} that have been used in the literature, such as\\textit{ machine learning} algorithms~ and \\textit{association analysis}~. Finally, we categorize the research works based on their scope of analysis and from security point of view into \\textit{vanilla DNS}~ and \\textit{DNSSEC}~.", "cites": [2072, 7537, 2070, 7536], "cite_extract_rate": 0.041666666666666664, "origin_cites_number": 96, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple sources to present a structured overview of DNS threats and their interplay with various attack vectors.

The critical analysis is moderate, as it points to the persistence of threats despite research efforts and hints at limitations (e.g., circumvention of DNS patches), but lacks detailed evaluation of methods or solutions. Abstraction is limited to identifying general categories of threats and methods, without offering meta-level principles or overarching frameworks."}}

General flow of the DNS cache poisoning attack is illustrated in \\autoref{DNSCachePoisoning}. In this manner, users' queries might be directed to a fake destination with malicious content or advertisements. DNS cache poisoning compromises the correct operation of Internet services and can be used for malicious activities, such as distributing malware and spam, phishing attacks, credential theft, \\etc To this end, several research works have been conducted to detect and mitigate the DNS cache poisoning attacks~. \n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\small\n\\caption{Summary of the some of representative research works that have investigated DNS cache poisoning attacks.

In addition, they demonstrated that DNS query randomization with both random prefix and 0x20 encoding can be circumvented easily. Finally, they suggested the deployment of DNSSEC as a countermeasure to prevent DNS cache poisoning attacks. Furthermore, Weaver \\etal~ have analyzed a large number of measurement sessions from distinct IP addresses, collected by Netalyzr~, to understand the DNS behavior. Their analysis revealed that DNS infrastructure suffers from significant limitations, such as inefficient look-ups, unreliability of IP-level fragmentation, and ISP-driven manipulation of DNS.\nShulman and Waidner~ studied the security of DNS infrastructure and highlighted that although adoption of challenge-response defenses~ are prevalent, DNS infrastructure is highly exposed to cache poisoning attacks. The authors claimed that DNSSEC is a suitable solution to defend against cache poisoning attacks.  \nAntonakakis \\etal~ have studied open recursive DNS resolvers' cache poisoning attacks and have found that attackers generally point victims to rogue IP addresses. Therefore, they have proposed Anax, a system that examines the nature of cache poisoning attacks and automatically detects them. Anax analyses resource records and extracts a set of statistical features, such as domain name diversity, 2LD diversity, 3LD diversity\\footnote{xLD refers to the x-th level domain. In http://www.example.com, example.com is a 2nd level domain, and www.example.com is a 3rd level domain.}, \\etc Then, these features are fed into a set of learning algorithms, such as SVM, neural network, \\etc for cache poisoning attack detection. \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n\\node[devil,monitor, mirrored, minimum size=0.7cm, xshift=4.8cm, yshift=0cm]{};\n\\node[xshift=4.8cm, yshift=-0.8cm]{\\sf attacker};\n\\node[ xshift=3cm, yshift=0.25cm, rotate = 0,  text width=7cm, node distance=1cm, red]{\\textcircled{\\tiny 1} {\\sf \\footnotesize inject fake DNS entry}};\n\\node[ xshift=3.5cm, yshift=-0.3cm, rotate = 0,  text width=7cm, node distance=1cm, red]{ {\\sf \\footnotesize example.com IP:4.3.2.1}};\n\\draw [stealth-,red,thick] (-1.5,-0) -- (3.8,0);\n\\node[builder, monitor, minimum size=0.7cm,xshift=-2.5cm, yshift=0cm]{};\n\\node[xshift=-1.5cm, yshift=0.8cm]{\\sf DNS cache resolver};\n\\node[ xshift=0.5cm, yshift=-1.7cm, rotate = -35,  text width=5cm, node distance=1cm, red]{\\textcircled{\\tiny 3} {\\sf \\footnotesize example.com IP:4.3.2.1}};\n\\draw [-stealth,red,thick] (-1.7,-0.45) -- (1.1,-2.4);\n\\node[ xshift=-0.7cm, yshift=-2.1cm, rotate = -35,  text width=3cm, node distance=1cm, ,black]{\\textcircled{\\tiny 2} {\\sf \\footnotesize request for www.example.com}};\n\\draw [stealth-,black,thick] (-1.9,-0.7) -- (0.9,-2.65);\n\\node[businessman, monitor, minimum size=0.7cm,xshift=-2.5cm, yshift=-3cm]{};\n\\node[xshift=-2.5cm, yshift=-3.8cm]{\\sf original};\n\\node[ xshift=0.2cm, yshift=-3.3cm, rotate = 0,  text width=3cm, node distance=1cm, ,black]{ {\\sf \\footnotesize IP:1.2.3.4}};\n\\draw [stealth-,black,dotted] (-1.7,-3) -- (0.4,-3);\n\\node[criminal,monitor, mirrored, minimum size=0.7cm, xshift=4.8cm, yshift=-3cm]{};\n\\node[xshift=4.8cm, yshift=-3.8cm]{\\sf malicious};\n\\node[ xshift=3.4cm, yshift=-3.3cm, rotate = 0,  text width=3cm, node distance=1cm, red]{\\textcircled{\\tiny 4} {\\sf \\footnotesize IP:4.3.2.1}};\n\\draw [-stealth,red,thick] (1.6,-3) -- (4,-3);\n\\node[bob,monitor, mirrored, minimum size=0.7cm, xshift=1.2cm, yshift=-3cm]{};\n\\node[xshift=1.2cm, yshift=-3.8cm]{\\sf user};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\caption{DNS cache poisoning attack.

WSEC DNS incorporates wildcard domains with TXT resource records to secure recursive DNS servers from cache poisoning attacks. WSEC DNS can be easily deployed, since it does not require any modifications of the root and TLD name servers. \nWu \\etal~ have proposed a DNS cache poisoning attack detection system based on the Kalman filter technique. The proposed system is composed of two subsystems: an entropy sequence, which is modeled using state space equations, and a second Kalman filter method, which is used to detect the attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed system is illustrated for both single and distributed cache poisoning attacks. The measurement errors and the correlation variation of the prediction errors are utilized for detection of the single and the distributed cache poisoning attacks, respectively. \nChen \\etal~ have investigated the impact of disposable domains on the caching behavior of the DNS resolvers. Their analysis showed that as the prevalence of the disposable domains increase, it is likely that the DNS cache begins to be filled with resource records that are unlikely to be reused. In addition, their analysis revealed that disposable domains not only are widely used by different industries, such as Anti-Virus companies, \\eg McAfee, Sophos, and popular websites, \\eg Microsoft, Google, social networks, \\eg Facebook, \\etc, but also are increasing in that trend. \nSimilarly, Hao and Wang~ have studied the negative impact of one-time-use domain names on the performance of DNS caching. Therefore, they proposed a one-time-use domain detection system that incorporates syntactical features extracted from domain name string, such as length of query name, length of the longest sub-domain name, Sub-domain depth, \\etc with machine learning algorithms is proposed. The authors argue that removal or even not inserting such resource records into the cache can prevent from waste of the DNS cache resources. \n\\BfPara{Discussion} Different research works have proposed various methods for detection and mitigation of DNS cache poisoning attacks. These methods and their strengths and weaknesses are summarized \\autoref{tab:SumCachePoisoning}. The limitations of proposed solutions can be summarized as:. \n\\begin{enumerate*}\n    \\item low deployment rate of DNSSEC~, which by design address cache poisoning, calling for further exploration of how to creates incentives for the spread of DNSSEC deployment. \n    \\item low detection accuracy~, calling for better accuracy using multiple types of features. \\item causing overheads on DNS traffic, memory usage and increasing response latency~, calling for lightweight and more efficient approaches. \n    \\item and wasting DNS cache storage resources by prefetching unpopular resource records~, which calls for adaptive resolution. \n\\end{enumerate*}", "cites": [7537], "cite_extract_rate": 0.08333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 12, "insight_result": {"type": "comparative", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic synthesis of the cited works by grouping them under DNS cache poisoning and comparing their methods and limitations via a table.

Phishwish analyzes text and HTML formatted emails using four general rules: identification and analysis of the log-in URL in the email, analysis of the email headers, analysis of the images in the email, and analysis of the accessibility of the URLs.\nMedvet \\etal~ presented a phishing detection method based on the visual-similarity that works based on analyzing three main characteristics of websites; the text pieces, the embedded images in the page, and the overall visual appearance of the website. A similarity signature is calculated for legitimate and suspicious websites and an alarm is raised if the signatures were too similar. \nFurthermore, Hara \\etal  have proposed a phishing detection technique based on visual similarity that works even if the original website is not registered in the database. A collection of legitimate websites are used to train the classifier and store in a database. A suspected website's snapshot is then compared to the websites in the database; the suspected website is labeled as phishing if the image similarity metric is above a certain threshold. In case where there is no similar website in the database the suspected website is considered as legitimate website.  \n\\BfPara{Discussion} Despite the large number of research works that have studied the detection and mitigation of phishing attacks, the landscape of phishing is an expanding area contributing very much to the DNS security landscape. \\autoref{tab:SumPhishing} summarizes the proposed methods in the literature and their strengths and weaknesses.

DNS manipulation behavior of attackers exposes users to threats, such as phishing and content injection. It is thus not a surprise that a large number of studies have focused on DNS manipulation . \nFor instance, the vulnerability of the user-side DNS infrastructure to record injection threats have been measured by Schomp \\etal~. Their analysis showed that a large number (9\\%) of open DNS resolvers are vulnerable to record injection attacks and are abused by attacks on shared DNS infrastructure. They have measured the extent of popular record injection attacks, \\eg Kaminsky~ and the deployment of familiar defensive methods, \\eg 0x20 encoding~.  \nKuhrer \\etal~ have investigated the negative aspects of open DNS resolvers that can be abused by attackers for various malicious activities, \\eg amplification DDoS attacks, DNS manipulation, and cache poisoning, among others. The authors have investigated the response authenticity of the open resolvers from the user's point of view, and found that millions of them deliberately manipulate DNS resolutions for censoring communication channels, injecting advertisements, serving malicious files, and performing phishing attacks.  Furthermore, Jones \\etal~ have proposed an approach for the detection of unauthorized DNS root manipulation using two different techniques. The first technique analyzes the latency to root servers and the second technique analyzes route hijacks. Their analysis revealed that the entities that are operating unauthorized root servers can completely control the entire Internet name space for any system within their sphere. \nPearce \\etal~ proposed a scalable and lightweight system, called Iris, which measures and detects the widespread of DNS manipulation at the scale of countries, which were manipulated based on tactics that rely on DNS resolvers. Iris collects DNS queries through geographically distributed DNS resolvers and analyzes the responses based on two metrics, the consistency and the independent verifiability metrics. Iris investigates both sensitive domains and domains of popular websites for DNS manipulation. Their analysis showed that DNS manipulation is a phenomenon that is heterogeneous across resolvers, domain names, and countries.\nTrevisan \\etal~ proposed an automatic and parameter-free detection system, called REMeDy, which identifies rogue DNS resolvers. REMeDy analyzes DNS traffic and evaluates the consistency of responses across all resolvers for automatic identification of manipulated responses.\n\\BfPara{Discussion} DNS infrastructure suffers from multiple issues, \\eg inefficient look-ups, unreliability of IP-level fragmentation, and ISP-driven DNS manipulation~. Moreover, record injection vulnerabilities, \\eg Kaminsky~ are widespread . Attackers can utilize standard-conforming resolvers to circumvent mitigation techniques \\eg source port randomization as well as IP address randomization~ to manipulate DNS. In addition, ISPs are clearly willing to involve in DNS manipulation for reasons, such as error traffic monetization~.  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that root servers can be abused by unauthorized entities for malicious activities, such as blocking access to websites or manipulate responses through MITM proxies~.  \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{fig/MDD_ML.pdf}\n\\caption{General flow of the malicious domains detection based on machine learning algorithms.

Notwithstanding, in the form of malicious domains, they are an essential apparatus in the hands of miscreants. There are no silver bullets for securing against malicious domains. Nonetheless, understanding domain names can enable firms and individual stakeholders to protect themselves against attacks. A wide variety of research works have been done for accurate detection of malicious domain names. \nThis work is classified into two general categories, classification based~ and inference based~. The classification based approaches rely on local network and host information; however, inference based approach exploits the global information along with local information. The general structure of the malicious domain detection systems based on classification approaches is shown in \\autoref{MDD_ML}.  \n\\BfPara{Classification based approach} Antonakakis \\etal~ have presented a malicious domain detection system, Notos, which works based on assigning dynamic reputation score to any domain name in a DNS query. Notos maintains up-to-date DNS information of domain names by gathering such information from various sources such as the DNS zone and associated IP addresses, BGP prefixes, AS information, and honeypot analysis. This information is then used to build models of benign/malicious domain names, and then used to calculate the reputation scores of new domains indicative of their maliciousness. \nInstead of monitoring traffic from local recursives, Antonakakis \\etal~ presented Kopis, which detects malware-related domains by monitoring DNS traffic at the upper DNS hierarchy. Kopis offers a new set of traffic features, including daily patterns of domain name resolution, the significance of requesters within each epoch, and the reputation of IP addresses that leverage a global visibility, thus leading to an early detection of malicious domains. Kopis offers independent malware domain detection within DNS operator's authority and works well even if there is no available information about IP reputation.\nBilge \\etal~ have presented a malicious domain detection system, called EXPOSURE, which analyzes a large set of passive DNS records. EXPOSURE analyzes various characteristics of DNS names and the way that they are queried, and extracts various kinds of features, namely time-based feature, DNS answer-based features, TTL value-based features, and domain name-based feature. These features are then used to design a decision tree based classifier that automatically detects a wide range of malicious domain names, \\eg botnet C\\&C servers, phishing sites, and scam hosts. Later they extended their work by analyzing a large set of real-world DNS requests over 17 months period of EXPOSURE's operation~. They showed that EXPOSURE is able to make meaningful connections between various malicious domains. For example, there exist IP addresses that are shared among thousands of unique domain names indicative of botnet-related domain names. \nJin \\etal~ have investigated the characteristics of the DNS log of botnet domain resolution to extract representative features, \\eg Number of source IPs, Total querying per day, Querying per hour \\etc These features are then used to build a malicious domain detection system that consists of three different classification algorithms: Adaboost, DT, and NB.  \n\\BfPara{Inference-based approach} Strong associations of domains with known malicious domains is a vital point in effective malicious domain detection. Therefore, Khalil \\etal~ have designed an association-based scheme for the detection of malicious domains with high accuracy and coverage. They have analyzed active DNS data and extracted two types of features, namely, domain based features and IP block based features. These features are then used to accurately distinguish public IPs from dedicated ones, consequently building high-quality associations between domain names and identifying malicious domains.  \nFurthermore, Gao \\etal~ have utilized temporal correlation analysis of DNS queries to detect unknown malicious domains based on the related known malicious anchor domains. The proposed approach is able to detect a wide range of correlated malicious domain groups, \\eg phishing, spam, and DGA-generated domains. The results demonstrated that on average each of the known malicious anchor domains can detect more than 53 previously unknown malicious domains.\nLuo \\etal~ have proposed a comprehensive framework that uses evolutionary learning for detection of diverse clusters of DNS failures, \\eg highly random, mutated string, and sub-string domain name failure patterns using different syntactic and temporal patterns. In order to reduce the computational cost, less suspicious clusters were removed while more suspicious cases were preserved for further analysis. \n\\BfPara{Time-of-registration detection} Early detection of potentially malicious DNS domains are of high importance for network operators, registries or registrars, and law enforcement professionals to defend against many Internet attacks. Therefore, Hao \\etal~ have explored registration behaviors of malicious domains with an eye towards features that might indicate the maliciousness of a domain at the time of registration. The characteristics of registrars, domains life cycle, and names patterns were investigated and the results showed that spammers use a small set of registrars to register previously used domains in bulk. \nHao \\etal ~ have proposed a malicious domain detection system, PREDATOR, that proactively detects malicious domains using time-of-registration statistical features, including registration history features, domain profile features, and batch correlation features. These features are used to build ML-based classifier, \\eg SVM, CMP that detects malicious domains before they appear in DNS blacklists. Moreover, Felegyhazi \\etal~ proposed an approach for proactive malicious domain blacklisting that relies on registration and name server information of small set of known malicious domains to predict whether a larger set of domains are malicious. Their analysis showed that on average 3.5 to 15 new domains can be derived from a given known malicious domain. \n\\BfPara{Web-based approach} Ma \\etal~ have studied application of batch and online learning approaches for detection of malicious web sites using live feed of labeled URLs and based on the lexical and host-based features. Their analysis showed that size of the training dataset and changes on the distribution of the features affects the performance of the batch algorithms. However, online confidence weighted algorithm is able to classify the labeled URLs in real time and with high accuracy.\nFurthermore, Canali \\etal~ have proposed a malicious web pages detection system based on a fast and reliable filter, Prophiler, that filters out benign web pages from further costly analysis. Prophiler examines a web page for malicious contents using different types of static features, such as HTML features, JavaScript features, URL and host-based features. \n\\BfPara{Discussion} Although there exists a large body of research devoted to detection of malicious domain names, miscreants have used the DNS to build malicious network infrastructure, \\eg botnet~. The summary of the proposed methods and their strengths and weaknesses are listed in~\\autoref{tab:SumMaliciousDomains}. Shortcomings of the proposed methods can be summarized as following: low detection accuracy~, local visibility~, expensive computation~, dependency on training dataset~, requiring correlation between anchor malicious domain and unknown malicious domains~, and can be evaded by avoiding certain features or behaviors~.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{fig/DGAStructure.pdf}\n\\caption{The General overview of the communication of the malware-infected hosts with C\\&C servers.

For instance, Wang \\etal~ have discovered common typo-generation models of Alexa top domain list, namely missing-dot typos, character-omission typos, character-permutation typos, character-substitution typos, and character-duplication typos. Similarly, Banerjee \\etal~ have suggested different methods for generating typosquatting domains, including 6.1-mod-inplace, 7.1-mod-deflate, and 8.1-mod-inflate. Furthermore, Spaulding \\etal~ have explored the landscape of the typosquatted domain names and summarized common typo-generation models and  monetization strategies, which are shown in~\\autoref{fig:Typosquatting}.\nAgten \\etal~ conducted a longitudinal study of typosquatting domains and trends. Their analysis showed that 95\\% of the studied top domains are targeted by typosquatters; however, only few trademark owners take protection practices, such as proactive registration of typosquatted domains. Furthermore, they observed a change in the trend and monetization behaviors of typosquatters over time and through hosting different types of websites, \\eg parked/ads/for sale domains and scams. \nMoreover, Szurdi \\etal~ conducted a large-scale measurement of typosquatting domain registrations in the .com TLD. This study explores the monetization strategies among less known domains. Their analysis showed that 95\\% of typosquatting domains target the long tail of the popularity distribution.

Their analysis showed that typosquatting practice increases the time it takes to find an intended website, generally 1.3 seconds per typosquatting event over the alternative of receiving a browser error page. \nSpaulding \\etal~ have conducted a user study to understand the effectiveness of the typosquatting strategies in deceiving users. The behaviour of users, who have been exposed to several typosquatting URLs, have been examined in an attempt to figure out whether their behavior is improved by security education and increasing their awareness about typosquatters.

The limitations of the existing research proposals can be summarized as following: 1) lack of practical yet automatic domain squatting detection system~, 2) requiring a huge amount of user traffic or content for building models~, and 3) lack of practical yet effective mitigation techniques~.

For example, Herrmann \\etal~ have explored the emerging threat of third-party DNS resolvers, \\eg  Google Public DNS and OpenDNS to online privacy and introduced a lightweight privacy-preserving name resolution service called \\textit{EncDNS}. EncDNS is designed based on the encapsulation of encrypted messages in standards-compliant DNS messages. EncDNS is compatible with existing popular DNS resolvers and offers low-latency DNS resolution.    \nFurthermore, Shulman~ have explored the existing proposals on DNS privacy that suggested encryption of DNS requests as a solution. The results demonstrated that a straightforward application of encryption alone may not provide the desired DNS privacy protection. \nKrishnan \\etal~ have explored the privacy implications of \\textit{DNS prefetching}. Their analysis showed that an adversary can abuse the context inserted to a resolver's cache through prefetching to launch disclosure attacks, \\eg reconstructing searched terms. Thus, they suggested that DNS prefetching should be turned off by default.\nZhu \\etal~ have presented a connection-oriented DNS, called \\textit{T-DNS}, to address the privacy and security issues of the connectionless DNS. T-DNS takes advantage of both TCP and TLS: while TCP protects the server against amplification attacks, TLS defends against eavesdroppers to the RDNS resolvers.\nIn addition, Reddy \\etal~ have explored the protection of the privacy-sensitive information of DNS queries and responses. They presented a protection mechanism, called the \\textit{Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)}, for DNS exchange. DTLS counters passive listening and active attacks. The proposed mechanism reduces the DTLS round trips and the handshake size as well.\nZhao \\etal~ have investigated the privacy disclosure of DNS queries and proposed a privacy-preserving query scheme, called \\textit{Range Query}, which reduces privacy disclosure by concealing the actual queries using noisy traffic. However, Castillo-Perez and Garc{\\'{\\i}}a{-}Alfaro~ demonstrated that the privacy ensured by noisy traffic is not only difficult to analyze, but also does introduce undesired latency and bandwidth consumption. Castillo-Perez and Garc{\\'{\\i}}a{-}Alfaro~ have evaluated two DNS privacy-preserving proposals, the \\textit{Range Query}~ and the \\textit{Privacy Information Retrieval (PIR)} schemes~. They demonstrated that both of these approaches are not desired. The first approach increases the latency and the bandwidth  during the execution and resolution of queries. Although the second approach is designed to address the limitations of the first approach, \\eg bandwidth consumption, its functionality requires major modification of the DNS protocol, and relies on the use of DNSSEC.\nLu and Tsudik~ explored DNS privacy leaks during domain resolution and presented Privacy-Preserving DNS (PPDNS) that mitigates the privacy issues in DNS. PPDNS takes advantage of both distributed hash tables (DHTs) and computational private information retrieval (cPIR). While DHT is an alternative naming infrastructure that provides name resolution query privacy, cPIR reduces communication overhead. However, Federrath \\etal~ argue that although PPDNS provides high level of privacy, it would not be adopted in the near future due to its computational complexity and requirement for completely different DNS infrastructure. \nDNS blocking of unintended queries is among the suggested solutions to improve the DNS privacy. For example, Appelbaum and Muffett~ have studied Tor's privacy and suggested to block .onion names at stub, recursive, and authoritative resolvers to improve it's privacy. Mohaisen and Ren~ have investigated the leakage of .onion at the A and J DNS root nodes over a longitudinal period of time and have found that .onion leakage is common and persistent at DNS infrastructure. Furthermore, Mohaisen \\etal~ have studied the impact of blocking of unintended queries under different adversarial settings on the DNS privacy. The results highlighted that partial blocking at stub resolver would negatively affect the DNS privacy under certain adversary models; however, blocking the queries at the recursive would result in favorable privacy outcomes. \n\\BfPara{Discussion} Full and proper deployment of DNSSEC relies on cooperation between domain owners, name server owners, registries, and ISPs. Thus, various methods have been proposed to improve the privacy of DNS which are listed in~\\autoref{tab:SumPrivacy} along with their strengths and weaknesses.  It should be noted that DNSSEC does not necessarily protect privacy. \nAlthough DNS over TLS protects against eavesdropping, it is not clear what  of privacy it offers. In addition, existing approaches require modifications to the DNS protocols~. Privacy issues have been overlooked by DNS security efforts (such as DNSSEC) and are thus likely to propagate into future versions of DNS~, requiring further attention.\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Topical classification threats addressed in the literature, with sample work.

Active DNS measurement cannot be a replacement for passive DNS measurement; however, it offers several advantages in comparison to its counterpart~. For example, Internet activities of real users would not fluctuate active measurements. In addition, active DNS measurements could be largely available with least privacy concerns, while it offers an order of magnitude more domain names and IP addresses. Therefore, researchers have developed and used active DNS measurement systems to address DNS security threats~. Generally, active DNS collection systems are composed of four main components: domain seeds, query generator, collection point, and storage. The list of the domains to be queried are gathered in domain seeds. These lists are requested using query generator and the responses are collected at the collection point and then stored in Hadoop cluster for further analysis. High-level architecture of active DNS collection system is shown in~\\autoref{ActiveDNS_arch}. \nKountouras \\etal~ have presented an active DNS measurement called Thales, which reliably queries, collects, and distills active DNS datasets. A set of large-scale seed domain list including public blacklists~, the Alexa list~, the Common Crawl dataset~, the domain feed from an undisclosed security vendor, and the zone files for the TLDs consisting of .com, .net, .biz and .org constitute the list of seed domains. Moreover, Van Rijswijk-Deij \\etal~ have presented OpenINTEL, an active DNS measurement system that conducts daily measurement for all of the domains in .com, .net, and .org TLDs. OpenINTEL reliably queries and collects over 50\\% of the global DNS data based on daily active measurements and since February 2015.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.46\\textwidth]{fig/ActiveDNS.pdf}\n\\caption{High-level architecture of a typical active DNS collection system.

Kintis \\etal~ have analyzed 455 billion DNS RRs collected daily through the active DNS project~ from November 2015 to August 2016, to investigate how attackers utilize combosquatting to conduct variety of malicious activities including trademark infringement, malware, monetization, and phishing. Moreover, Khalil \\etal~ have conducted an in-depth analysis of active DNS dataset provided by Thales~ to design an association-based scheme for detection of malicious domains with high accuracy and coverage.\nChung \\etal~ have collected all DNSSEC-enabled domain names, under the .com, .org, and .net TLDs through OpenINTEL active DNS measurement system~, to study the adoption and management of DNSSEC in both authoritative name servers and DNS resolvers. Moreover, Toorn \\etal ~ have studied the detection of Snowshoe spams through active DNS measurement and using machine learning techniques. \n\\BfPara{Discussion} Passive monitoring is better suited as a technology to determine what goes wrong with a website or web application after problems have occurred. Passive DNS, though, is rare, difficult to obtain, and often comes with restrictive legal clauses (i.e., non disclosure agreements). At the same time, laws and regulations against personal identifiable information, the significant financial cost of the passive collection, and storage infrastructure are some of the reasons that make passive DNS difficult. In addition, passive DNS datasets are limited in scope and time. On the other hand, although active DNS datasets offer several unique characteristics, the amount of offered information would be limited. It should be noticed that active DNS measurement highly relies on the domain seeds. In addition, issued DNS queries based on the limited set of hosts yields a localized DNS data collection. In other words, the collected DNS data is limited to the locations of those hosts, thus all IPs associated with a specific given name might not be identified. Furthermore, DNS queries are made by data collectors not by individual users, which makes active DNS data less suitable as an approach to detect malicious domains based on user level features of DNS data, such as user query patterns.

Kuhrer \\etal~ have analyzed the threats in open resolvers from two perspectives. Firstly, they scanned the DNS resolvers' landscape for changes in the course of time and categorized the resolvers based on their device type and the software version. Secondly, they measured the response authenticity of the resolvers from the users' point-of-view to find that a large number of resolvers intentionally manipulate DNS resolutions for malicious activities.\nSchomp \\etal~ have measured the vulnerability of the user-side DNS infrastructure to record injection threats. They have found that many open DNS resolvers, that are vulnerable to record injection attacks, are used as an attack vector to target shared DNS infrastructure. Verma \\etal~ presented a system to mitigate Amplified DNS DDoS (ADD) attacks, that relies on the fact that DNS resolvers share local DNS query rates that can be used to calculate the total query rates.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.44\\textwidth]{fig/RecursiveResolver.pdf}\n        \\centering\n        \\caption{Overview of recursive DNS resolver.

Notice that ORDNS resolver does respond to queries of both internal and external clients.}\n        \\label{ODNS}\n\\end{figure}\nBallani \\etal~ have presented a defense scheme called stale cache, that uses caching behavior to prevent DNS DoS attacks.They have analyzed DNS traces under multiple DoS attack strategies and have found that the cost-benefit ratio of the proposed method, favors the deployment of stale cache. Furthermore, Herrmann \\etal~ have studied third party DNS resolvers and consequent threats to online privacy. They proposed a new privacy-preserving name resolution service that relies on the encapsulation of encrypted messages in standards-compliant DNS messages.  Hendriks \\etal~ presented an active measurement system to find the list of open DNS resolvers on IPv6 in the wild, which could be potentially exploited in a DDoS attack. Moreover, Schomp \\etal~ have studied the vulnerabilities of shared DNS resolvers and proposed an unorthodox method to tackle such threats.\n\\BfPara{Discussion} DNS resolvers can be easily discovered and used by the attackers for malicious activities, such as DoS attacks. Moreover, buggy implementations and large DNSSEC response filtering can lead to a high query latency. Although extensive research has been conducted on open DNS resolvers, their evolution and distribution still require a clear demonstration. Some open questions that are worth addressing in this regard are: \n\\begin{enumerate*}\n    \\item How is the distribution of open DNS resolvers in popular TLDs?\n    \\item  Are open resolvers consistent in answering various clients for the same query type? \n\\end{enumerate*}\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Topical classification of the DNS research scopes addressed in the literature, with sample work; NS=Name Servers, R=Resolvers, HS=Hosting Services, and C=Clients.}\n\\label{tab:DNS_Entity}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l}\n\\Xhline{2\\arrayrulewidth}\nWork\t&\t\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{NS}} \t&\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{R}}\t\t&\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{HS}}\t\t&\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{C}} & Work\t&\t\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{NS}} \t&\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{R}}\t\t&\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{HS}}\t\t&\\rotatebox{90}{\\textbf{C}}\t\t\\\\ \n\\Xhline{2\\arrayrulewidth}\n  &  &  & \\cmark & \t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n  & \\cmark &  &  &  \t&\t \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n & \\cmark &  &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n & \\cmark &  & \\cmark &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t \t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t \t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t\\\\ \\hline\n & \\cmark &  &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t\\\\ \\hline\n & \\cmark &  & \\cmark &  \t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n & \\cmark & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  &  & \\cmark &  \t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  &  \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  &  &  & \\cmark \t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  & \\cmark &  & \\cmark \t&\t\t&\t\t&\t\\cmark\t&\t\t&\t\t\\\\ \\hline\n &  &  & \\cmark &  \t& &&&&\t \\\\\n\\Xhline{2\\arrayrulewidth}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}", "cites": [7537], "cite_extract_rate": 0.02631578947368421, "origin_cites_number": 38, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple cited works to highlight common threats and defense mechanisms related to open DNS resolvers, such as manipulation of DNS responses and DDoS attacks.
