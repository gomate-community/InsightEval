We refer to this research area as \\emph{\\ebhd (\\EBHD)}, as a general umbrella term encompassing  \\emph{explanatory debugging}  and \\emph{human-in-the-loop debugging} .\nWe define \\EBHD as the process of fixing or mitigating bugs in a trained model using human feedback given in response to explanations for the model.\n\\EBHD is helpful when the training data at hand leads to suboptimal models (due, for instance, to biases \nor artifacts in the data), and hence human knowledge is needed to verify and improve the trained models.  \nIn fact, \\EBHD is related to three challenging and intertwined issues in NLP: explainability , interactive and human-in-the-loop learning , and knowledge integration . \nAlthough there are overviews for each of these topics\n(as cited above), our paper is the first to draw connections among the three towards the final application of model debugging in NLP.\n\\begin{figure*}[t] \n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.90\\linewidth]{figs/workflow-options-7.pdf}\n    \\caption{A general framework for \\ebhd (\\EBHD) of NLP models, consisting of the inspected (potentially buggy) model, the humans providing feedback, and a three-step workflow.

For instance, \\textit{input-based explanations} (so called feature importance explanations) identify parts of the input that are important for the prediction. \nThe explanation could be \na list of importance scores of words in the input, so called \\textit{attribution scores} or \\textit{relevance scores} .\n\\textit{Example-based explanations} select influential, important, or similar examples from the training set to explain why the model makes a specific prediction .\n\\textit{Rule-based explanations} provide interpretable decision rules that approximate the prediction process\n.\n\\textit{Adversarial-based explanations} return the smallest changes in the inputs that could change the predictions, revealing the model misbehavior .\nIn most NLP tasks, \ninput-based explanations are the most popular approach for explaining predictions . This is also the case for \\EBHD as most selected studies use input-based explanations \nfollowed by example-based explanations\n. \nMeanwhile, only  use adversarial-based explanations, whereas  experiment with input-based, rule-based, and example-based explanations. \nFor the second question, there are two ways to generate the explanations: self-explaining methods and post-hoc explanation methods. Some models, e.g., Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and decision trees, are \\textit{self-explaining} (SE) , \nalso referred to as transparent  or inherently interpretable .\nLocal explanations of self-explaining models can be obtained at the same time as predictions, usually from the process of making those predictions, while \nthe models themselves can often serve directly as global explanations.\nFor example, feature importance explanations for a Naive Bayes model can be directly derived from the likelihood terms in the Naive Bayes equation, as done by several papers in Table~\\ref{tab:papers} .\nAlso, using attention scores on input as explanations, as done in , is a self-explaining method because the scores were obtained during the prediction process. \nIn contrast, \\textit{post-hoc explanation methods} (PH) perform additional steps to extract explanations after the model is trained (for a global explanation) or after the prediction is made (for a local explanation).\nIf the method is allowed to access model parameters, it may calculate word relevance scores by propagating the output scores back to the input words  or analyzing the derivative of the output with respect to the input words . \nIf the method cannot access the model parameters, it may perturb the input and see how the output changes to estimate the importance of the altered parts of the input .\nThe important words and/or the relevance scores can be presented to the feedback providers in the \\EBHD workflow in many forms such as a list of words and their scores , word clouds , and a parse tree . \nMeanwhile, the influence functions method, used in , identifies training examples which influence the prediction by analyzing how the prediction would change if we did not have each training point. This is another post-hoc explanation method as it takes place after prediction. \nIt is similar to the other two example-based explanation methods used in .", "cites": [8849, 4870, 4868, 1824, 7507, 3699, 1813, 7517, 7516, 4875, 4869], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5238095238095238, "origin_cites_number": 21, "insight_result": {"error": "Failed to parse LLM response", "raw_response": "{\n    \"type\": \"analytical\",\n    \"scores\": {\"synthesis\": 4.2, \"critical\": 3.0, \"abstraction\": 4.0},\n    \"insight_level\": \"high\",\n    \"analysis\": \"The section effectively synthesizes various explanation formats (input-based, example-based, rule-based, adversarial-based) and links them to \\EBHD, drawing from multiple papers.
