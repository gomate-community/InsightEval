Apart from anomalies shown in (b), graph anomaly detection also identifies graph-level anomalies, detailed in Sections~\\ref{sec:anosgd:db} and~\\ref{sec:anosgd:dynamic}.} \n\\label{Toy}\n\\end{figure}\nFor our purposes today, anomalies, which are also known as outliers, exceptions, peculiarities, rarities, novelties, etc., in different application fields, refer to abnormal objects that are significantly different from the standard, normal, or expected. \nAlthough these objects rarely occur in real-world, they contain critical information to support downstream applications. For example, the behaviors of fraudsters provide evidences for anti-fraud detection and abnormal network traffics reveal signals for network intrusion protection. Anomalies, in many cases, may also have real and adverse impacts, for instance, fake news in social media can create panic and chaos with misleading beliefs~, untrustworthy reviews in online review systems can affect customers' shopping choices~, network intrusions might leak private personal information to hackers~, and financial frauds can cause huge damage to economic systems~.\nAnomaly detection is the data mining process that aims to identify the unusual patterns that deviate from the majorities in a dataset~. In order to detect anomalies, conventional techniques typically represent real-world objects as feature vectors (\\eg news in social media are represented as bag-of-words~, and images in web pages are represented as color histograms~), and then detect outlying data points in the vector space~, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig1a}. \nAlthough these techniques have shown power in locating deviating data points under tabulated data format, they inherently discard the complex relationships between objects~.\nYet, in reality, many objects have rich relationships with each other, which can provide valuable complementary information for anomaly detection.\nTake online social networks as an example, fake users can be created using valid information from normal users or they can camouflage themselves by mimicking benign users' attributes~. \nIn such situations, fake users and benign users would have near-identical features, and conventional anomaly detection techniques might not be able to identify them using feature information only. \nMeanwhile, fake users always build relationships with a large number of benign users to increase their reputation and influence so they can get unexpected benefits, whereas benign users rarely exhibit such activities~.\nHence, these dense and unexpected connections formed by fake users denote their deviations to the benigns and more comprehensive detection techniques should take these structural information into account to pinpoint the deviating patterns of anomalies.\nTo represent the structural information, \\textit{Graphs}, in which nodes/vertices denote real objects, and the edges denote their relationships, have been prevalently used in a range of application fields~, including social activities, e-commerce, biology, academia and communication. With the structural information contained in graphs, detecting anomalies in graphs raises a more complex anomaly detection problem in non-Euclidean space - graph anomaly detection (GAD) that aims to identify anomalous graph objects (\\ie nodes, edges or sub-graphs) in a single graph as well as anomalous graphs among a set/database of graphs~.\nAs a toy example shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig1b}, given an online social network, graph anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous nodes (\\ie malicious users), anomalous edges (\\ie abnormal relations) and anomalous sub-graphs (\\ie malicious user groups).\nBut, because the copious types of graph anomalies cannot be directly represented in Euclidean feature space, it is not feasible to directly apply traditional anomaly detection techniques to graph anomaly detection, and researchers have intensified their efforts to GAD recently.\nAmongst earlier works in this area, the detection methods relied heavily on handcrafted feature engineering or statistical models built by domain experts~.\nThis inherently limits these techniques' capability to detect unknown anomalies, and the exercise tended to be very labor-intensive. \nMany machine learning techniques, such as matrix factorization~ and SVM~, have also been applied to detect graph anomalies.\nHowever, real-world networks often contain millions of nodes and edges that result in extremely high dimensional and large-scale data, and these techniques do not easily scale up to such data efficiently.\nPractically, they exhibit high computational overhead in both the storage and execution time~.\nThese general challenges associated with graph data are significant for the detection techniques, and we categorize them as data-specific challenges (Data-CHs) in this survey.\nA summary of them is provided in Appendix~\\ref{appendix:data-challenges}.\n\\begin{table*}[!h]\n\\centering \n\\footnotesize\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2.8mm}{\n\\caption{A Comparison Between Existing Surveys on Anomaly Detection.

Anomaly-aware training objectives.} Deep learning models rely heavily on the training objectives to fine-tune all the trainable parameters. \nFor graph anomaly detection, this necessitates appropriate training objectives or loss functions such that the GADL models can effectively capture the differences between benign and anomalous objects.\nDesigning anomaly-aware objectives is very challenging because there is no prior knowledge about the ground-truth anomalies as well as their deviating patterns versus the majority.\nHow to effectively separate anomalies from normal objects through training remains critical for deep learning-based models.\n\\textbf{Tech-CH2. Anomaly interpretability.} In real-world scenarios, the interpretability of detected anomalies is also vital because we need to provide convincing evidence to support the subsequent anomaly handling process. For example, the risk management department of a financial organization must provide lawful evidence before blocking the accounts of identified anomalous users. \nAs deep learning has been limited for its interpretability~, how to justify the detected graph anomalies remains a big challenge for deep learning techniques.\n\\textbf{Tech-CH3. High training cost.} Although D(G)NNs are capable of digesting rich information (\\eg structural information and attributes) in graph data for anomaly detection, these GADL models are more complex than conventional deep neural networks or machine learning methods due to the anomaly-aware training objectives. Such complexity inherently leads to high training costs in both time and computing resources.\n\\textbf{Tech-CH4. Hyperparameter tuning.} D(G)NNs naturally exhibit a large set of hyperparameters, such as the number of neurons in each neural network layer, the learning rate, the weight decay and the number of training epochs. Their learning performance is significantly affected by the values of these hyperparameters. However, it remains a serious challenge to effectively select the optimal/sub-optimal settings for the detection models due to the lack of labeled data in real scenarios.\nBecause deep learning models are sensitive to their associated hyperparameters, setting well-performing values for the hyperparameters is vital to the success of a task.\nTuning hyperparameter is relatively trivial in supervised learning when labeled data are available. For instance, users can find an optimal/sub-optimal set of hyperparameters (\\eg through random search, grid search) by comparing the model's outputs with the ground-truth. However, unsupervised anomaly detection has no accessible labeled data to judge the model's performance under different hyperparameter settings~. Selecting the ideal hyperparameter values for unsupervised detection models persists as a critical obstacle to applying them in a wide range of real scenarios.", "cites": [6279, 4539, 6280], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a coherent analytical overview of key challenges in using deep learning for graph anomaly detection, and it integrates insights from the cited papers, particularly linking the meta-learning approach for hyperparameter tuning (Paper 1) and the interpretability issues of deep learning (Paper 2).

The graph convolutional encoder generates node embeddings through multiple graph convolutional layers. The structure reconstruction decoder tends to reconstruct the network structure from the learned node embeddings, while the attribute reconstruction decoder reconstructs the node attribute matrix.\nThe whole neural network is trained to minimize the following loss function:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:ad}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{DOMINANT} &= (1-\\alpha)\\mathcal{R}_{S} + \\alpha \\mathcal{R}_{A}\\\\\n                &= (1-\\alpha)||A - \\hat{A}||_{F}^{2} + \\alpha||X - \\hat{X}||_{F}^{2},\n    \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the coefficient, $A$ depicts the adjacency matrix of the graph, $\\mathcal{R}_{S}$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{A}$ quantify reconstruction errors with regard to the graph structure and node attributes, respectively.\nWhen the training is finished, an anomaly score is then assigned to each node according to its contribution to the total reconstruction error, which is calculated by:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:nodescore}\n  \\textit{score}(i) \n      = (1-\\alpha)||\\mathbf{a}_{i} - \\mathbf{\\hat{a}}_{i}||_{2} + \\alpha||\\mathbf{x}_{i} - \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{i}||_{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ are the structure vector and attribute vector of node $i$, $\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{i}$ are their corresponding reconstructed vectors. \nThe nodes are then ranked according to their anomaly scores in descending order, and the top-k nodes are recognized as anomalies.\nTo enhance the performance of anomalous node detection, later work by Peng \\etal~ further explores node attributes from multiple attributed views to detect anomalies.\nThe multiple attributed views are employed to describe different perspectives of the objects~.\nFor example, in online social networks, user's demographic information and posted contents are two different attributed views, and they characterize the personal information and social activities, respectively.\nThe underlying intuition of investigating different views is that anomalies might appear to be normal in one view but abnormal in another view.\nFor the purpose of capturing these signals, the proposed method, ALARM, applies multiple GCNs to encode information in different views and adopts a weighted aggregation of them to generate node representations.\nThis model's training strategy is similar to DOMINANT~ in that it aims to minimize the network reconstruction loss and attribute reconstruction loss and can be formulated as:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:alarmloss}\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{L}_{ALARM} = & \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n - [\\gamma A_{ij}\\log\\hat{A}_{ij} + (1-A_{ij})\\log(1-\\hat{A}_{ij})] \\\\\n                      & + ||X - \\tilde{X}||^{F}_{2},\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\gamma$ is coefficient to balance the errors, $A_{ij}$ is the element at coordinate $(i,j)$ in the adjacency matrix $A$, $\\hat{A}_{ij}$ is the corresponding element in the reconstructed adjacency matrix $\\hat{A}$, $X$ is the original node feature matrix and $\\tilde{X}$ is the reconstructed node feature matrix.\nLastly, ALARM adopts the same scoring function as~, and nodes with top-k highest scores are anomalous.\nInstead of spotting unexpected nodes using their reconstruction errors, Li \\etal~ proposed SpecAE to detect global anomalies and community anomalies via a density estimation approach, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).\nGlobal anomalies can be identified by only considering the node attributes. \nFor community anomalies, the structure and attributes need to be jointly considered because of their distinctive attributes to the neighbors.\nAccordingly, SpecAE investigates a graph convolutional encoder to learn node representations and reconstruct the nodal attributes through a deconvolution decoder.\nThe parameters in the GMM are then estimated using the node representations. \nDue to the deviating attribute patterns of global and community anomalies, normal nodes are expected to exhibit greater energies in GMM, and the k nodes with the lowest probabilities are deemed to be anomalies.\nIn~, Wang \\etal developed a novel detection model that identify fraudsters using their relations and features. Their proposed method, Fdgars, first models online users' reviews and visited items as their features, and then identifies a small portion of significant fraudsters based on these features. In the last step, a GCN is trained in a semi-supervised manner by using the user-user network, user features, and labeled users. After training, the model can directly label unseen users.\nA more recent work, GraphRfi~, also explores the potential of combining anomaly detection with other downstream graph analysis tasks.\nIt targets on leveraging anomaly detection to identify malicious users and provide more accurate recommendations to service benign users by alleviating the impact of these untrustworthy users. \nSpecifically, a GCN framework is deployed to encode users and items into a shared embedding space for recommendation and users are classified as fraudsters or normal users through an additional neural random forest using their embeddings. \nFor rating prediction between users and items, the framework reduces the corresponding impact of suspicious users by assigning less weights to their training loss. \nAt the same time, the rating behavior of users also provides auxiliary information for fraudster detection. \nThe mutually beneficial relationship between these two applications (anomaly detection and recommendation) indicates the potential of information sharing among multiple graph learning tasks.", "cites": [6283, 6284], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2222222222222222, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple GCN-based techniques for anomalous node detection on attributed graphs, connecting ideas from DOMINANT, ALARM, SpecAE, Fdgars, and GraphRfi to illustrate a coherent narrative around the use of reconstruction errors and multi-view analysis.

A graph database $\\mathcal{G} = \\{ G_i = (V_i,E_i,X_v(i), X_e(i)) \\}^N_{i=1}$ contains $N$ individual graphs. Here, each graph $G_i$ is comprised of a node set $V_i$ and an edge set $E_i$. $X_v(i)$ and $X_e(i)$ are the node attribute matrix and edge attribute matrix of $G_i$ if it is an attributed graph.\nThis graph-level ANOS GD aims to detect individual graphs that deviate significantly from the others.\nA concrete example of ANOS GD is unusual molecule detection.\nWhen chemical compounds are represented as molecular/chemical graphs where the atoms and bonds are represented as nodes and edges~, unusual molecules can be identified because their corresponding graphs have structures and/or features that deviate from the others.\nBrain disorders detection is another example.\nA brain disorder can be diagnosed by analyzing the dynamics of brain graphs at different stages of aging in sequence and finding an inconsistent snapshot at a specific time stamp.\nThe prior reviewed techniques (\\ie ANOS ND/ED/SGD) are not compatible with ANOS GD because they are dedicated to detecting anomalies in a single graph, whereas ANOS GD is directed at detecting graph-level anomalies.\nThis problem is commonly approached by: 1) measuring the pairwise proximities of graphs using graph kernels~; 2) detecting the appearance of anomalous graph signals created by abnormal groups of nodes~; or 3) encoding graphs using frequent motifs~.\nHowever, none of these methods are deep learning-based.\nAs the time of writing, very few studies in ANOS GD with deep learning have been undertaken.

For instance, Teng \\etal~ applied a LSTM-autoencoder to detect abnormal graph snapshots, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{pic:GDdynamic}.\nIn their proposed model, DeepSphere, a dynamic graph is described as a collection of three-order tensors, $\\{\\mathcal{X}_k, k=1,2...\\}$ where each $\\mathcal{X} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{N \\times N \\times T}$, and the slices along the time dimension are the adjacency matrices of graph snapshots.\nTo identify abnormal tensors, DeepSphere first embeds each graph snapshot into a latent space using an LSTM autoencoder, and then leverages a one-class classification objective~ that learns a hypersphere such that normal snapshots are covered, and anomalous snapshots lay outside.\nThe LSTM autoencoder takes the adjacency matrices as input sequentially and attempts to reconstruct these input matrices through training.\nThe hypersphere is learned through a single neural network layer and its objective function is formulated as:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:ds:hsp}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{h} = r^{2} + \\gamma\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\epsilon_{k} + \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\|\\textbf{z}_{k} - \\textbf{a}\\|^{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\textbf{z}_{k}$ is the latent representation generated by the LSTM autoencoder, $\\textbf{a}$ is the centroid of the hypersphere, $r$ is the radius, $\\epsilon_{k}$ is the outlier penalty ($\\epsilon_{k} = \\|\\textbf{z}_{k} - \\textbf{a}\\|^{2} - r^2$), $m$ is the number of training graph snapshots, and $\\gamma$ is a hyperparameter.  \nThe overall objective function of DeepSphere is represented as:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:ds:obj}\n    \\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{h} + \\lambda\\mathcal{L}_{res},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{res}$ is the reconstruction loss of the LSTM autoencoder.\nWhen the training is finished, DeepSphere spots a given unseen data $\\mathcal{X}$ as anomalous if its embedding lies outside the learned hypersphere with a radius of $r$.\nIn addition to all ANOS ND, ED, SGD, and GD techniques reviewed above, it is worth mentioning that perturbed graphs, which adversarial models generate to attack graph classification algorithms or GNNs~, can also be regarded as (intensional) anomalies. In a perturbed graph, the nodes and edges are modified deliberately to deviate from the others. We have not reviewed these in this survey because their main purpose is to attack a GNN model. The key idea behind these methods is the attacking/perturbation strategy, and studies in this sphere seldom focus on a detection or reasoning module to identify the perturbed graph or its sub-structures, \\ie anomalous nodes, edges, sub-graphs, or graphs.\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering \n\\footnotesize\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2.8mm}\n\\caption{Published Algorithms and Models} \n\\resizebox{0.96\\textwidth}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|l}\n\\toprule[1 pt]\n\\textbf{Model} & \\textbf{Language} & \\textbf{Platform} &  \\textbf{Graph} & \\textbf{Code Repository} \\\\ \n\\midrule[1 pt]\nAnomalyDAE~  & Python & Tensorflow   & Static Attributed Graph & https://github.com/haoyfan/AnomalyDAE   \\\\ \\hline\nMADAN~    & Python & -

Ground-truth is scarce.} In most cases, there is little or no prior knowledge about the features or patterns of anomalies in real applications. Ground-truth anomalies are often identified by domain experts, and this generally cost-prohibitive. As a result, labeled ground-truth anomalies are often unavailable for analysis in a wide range of disciplines.\n\\textbf{Data-CH2. Various types of graphs.} Different graphs model different real-world data. For instance, plain graphs contain only structural information, attributed graphs contain both structural and attribute information, and heterogeneous graphs represent the complex relations between different types of objects.\nThese graphs reflect the real-world data in different forms, and graph anomalies will show different deviating patterns in different types of graphs.\n\\textbf{Data-CH3. Various types of graph anomalies.} Given a specific type of graph, graph anomalies could appear as a specific node, edge, sub-graph, or an entire graph, and each type of these anomalies is significantly different from others. This means detection methods must involve concise definitions of anomalies and be able to identify concrete clues about the deviating patterns of anomalies.\n\\textbf{Data-CH4. High dimensionality and large scale.} Representing the structure information of real-world networks usually results in high dimensional and large-scale data~ because real-world network often contain millions or billions of nodes. Graph anomaly detection techniques, hence, should be capable of handling such high dimensional and large scale data; this includes the ability to extract anomalous patterns under the constraints of execution time and feasible computing resources. \n\\textbf{Data-CH5. Interdependencies and dynamics.} The relationships between real objects reveal their interdependencies and they can no longer be treated individually for anomaly detection. That is to say, the detection techniques need to consider the deviating patterns of anomalies by assessing the pairwise, triadic, and higher relationships among objects restored in conventional graphs or hypergraphs~.\nIn addition, the dynamic nature of real-world networks makes detection problems much more challenging.\n\\textbf{Data-CH6. Class imbalance.} As anomalies are rare occurrences, only a very small proportion of the real-world data might be anomalous. This naturally introduces a critical class imbalance problem to anomaly detection because the number of normal objects is far greater than anomalies in the training data. If no further actions are taken to tackle this challenge, learning-based anomaly detection techniques might overlook the patterns of anomalies, leading to sub-optimal results.\n\\textbf{Data-CH7. Unknown and camouflage of anomalies.} In reality, knowledge about anomalies mainly stems from human expertise. There are still many unknown anomalies across different application domains, and new types of anomalies might appear in the future. Nevertheless, real-world anomalies can hide or be camouflaged as benign objects to bypass existing detection systems. In graphs, anomalies might hide themselves by connecting with many normal nodes or by mimicking their attributes. Detection methods, therefore, need to be adaptive to unknown and novel anomalies and robust to camouflaged anomalies.\nThese data-specific challenges and technical-specific challenges (discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:introdution:challenges}) are summarized in Table.~\\ref{tb:challenges}, along with the corresponding articles that aim to address them.\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering \n\\footnotesize\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2.8mm}\n\\caption{Challenges and Methods.}\n\\resizebox{0.48\\textwidth}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{m{1.1cm}<{\\centering}|m{2cm}<{\\centering}|m{2.9cm}<{\\centering}}\n\\toprule[1 pt]\n\\textbf{Challenges} & \\textbf{Details} &  \\textbf{Methods} \\\\ \n\\midrule[1 pt]\n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{Data-specific Challenges}} \\\\\n\\midrule[1 pt]\nData-CH1 & Ground-truth is scarce              &  \\\\ \n\\cline{1-3}\nData-CH2 & Various types of graphs             &  \\\\ \n\\cline{1-3}\nData-CH3 & Various types of graph anomalies    &  \\\\ \n\\cline{1-3}\nData-CH4 & High dimensionality and large scale &  \\\\ \n\\cline{1-3}\nData-CH5 & Interdependencies and dynamics      &  \\\\ \n\\cline{1-3}\nData-CH6 & Class imbalance                     &  \\\\ \n\\cline{1-3}\nData-CH7 & Unknown and camouflage of anomalies &  \\\\ \n\\midrule[1 pt]\n\\midrule[1 pt]\n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{Techniques-specific Challenges}} \\\\\n\\midrule[1 pt]\nTech-CH1 & Anomaly-aware training objectives   &  \\\\\\cline{1-3}\nTech-CH2 & Anomaly interpretability            &  \\\\\\cline{1-3}\nTech-CH3 & High training cost                  &  \\\\\\cline{1-3}\nTech-CH4 & Hyperparameter tuning              &  \\\\\n\\bottomrule[1 pt]\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tb:challenges}\n}\n\\end{table}", "cites": [6285, 6281, 6283, 6289, 6307, 6279, 6271, 6306, 6293, 5645, 8149, 6291, 6286], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3170731707317073, "origin_cites_number": 41, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section lists several challenges in graph anomaly detection and briefly mentions the need for methods to address them, but it does not deeply synthesize or integrate insights from the cited papers.

Each $\\theta_{i,j} \\in \\bm{\\theta}$ and $\\eta_{i,j} \\in \\bm{\\eta}$ is 1, if the corresponding element $A_{ij}$ and $X_{ij}$ equals 0, otherwise, their values are defined by hyperparameters greater than 1.\nAnother decent work is SemiGNN~, in which Wang \\etal proposed a semi-supervised attention-based graph neural network for detecting fraudulent users in online payment platforms.\nThis work further explores user information collected from various sources (\\eg transaction information and user profiles), and represents real-networks as multi-view graphs.\nEach view in the graph is modeled to reflect the relationship between users or the correlation between user attributes.\nFor anomaly detection, SemiGNN first generates node embedding $h_u^v$ from each view $v$ by aggregating neighbor information through a node-level attention mechanism.\nIt then employs view-level attention to aggregate node embeddings from each view and generates a unified representation $a_u$ for each node.\nLastly, the class of each node is predicted through a softmax classifier.\nIndeed, Wang \\etal designed a supervised classification loss and an unsupervised graph reconstruction loss to jointly optimize the model by fully utilizing labeled and unlabeled data.\nThe classification loss can be denoted as:\n\\begin{equation} \n    \\mathcal{L}_{sup} = - \\frac{1}{|U_L|}\\sum_{u \\in U_L} \\sum_{i=1}^{k}I(y_u=i)\\log\\frac{\\exp(a_u\\cdot\\theta_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\exp(a_u\\cdot\\theta_j)},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $U_L$ is the labeled user set and its size is $|U_L|$, $I(\\cdot)$ is an indicator function, $k$ is the number of labels to be predicted (in most cases, the label is either anomalies or non-anomalies, and $k=2$), and $\\theta$ represents the trainable variables.\nMeanwhile, the unsupervised loss encourages unlabeled nodes (users) that can be reached by labeled nodes through random walks to obtain similar representations and vice versa.\nThis is achieved by negative sampling (unlabeled nodes that cannot be reached by random walks are negative samples) and the loss can be formulated as:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\begin{split}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{unsup}  & = \\sum_{u\\in U}\\sum_{v\\in N_u \\cup Neg_{u}} -\\log(\\sigma(a_{u}^{T}a_{v})) \\\\\n    &- 3\\cdot E_{q\\sim P_{neg}(u)}\\log(\\sigma(a_{u}^{T}a_{q})),\n  \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $U$ denotes the user set, $N_u$ denotes the neighbor set of $u$, $Neg_{u}$ represents negative samples, $P$ is the sampling distribution, and $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function. The total loss takes the sum of them and is formulated as:\n\\begin{equation} \n    \\mathcal{L}_{SemiGNN} = \\alpha \\mathcal{L}_{sup} + (1- \\alpha) \\mathcal{L}_{unsup} + \\lambda \\mathcal{L}_{reg},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a balancing parameter and $\\mathcal{L}_{reg}$ regularizes all trainable variables.", "cites": [6291, 180, 6289], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from two GAT-based papers (AnomalyDAE and SemiGNN) by integrating their methodologies and highlighting how they differ in terms of supervision (unsupervised vs. semi-supervised).

Both matrices are jointly updated throughout the representation learning process so nearby nodes are encouraged to have similar representations.\nSpecifically, these node embeddings are generated by aggregating neighbor information with each node's own attributes, formulated as:\n\\begin{equation} \n    h_{i}^{l} = \\sigma \\left( W^l \\cdot \\text{CONCAT}\\{h_{i}^{l-1},h_{N_i}^{l}\\} + b^2\\right),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $h_{i}^{l}$ is node $i$'s representation generated by the $l$-th layer ($h_{i}^{0} = \\hat{X}$), $N_i$ contains $i$'s neighbors, $\\sigma()$ is the activation function, $W^{l}$ and $b$ are the trainable variables. Finally, the residual matrix $R$ will contain the abnormal information of each node and the top-k nodes with the largest norms are considered anomalies.\nGiven partial node labels, Liang \\etal~ developed a semi-supervised representation model, SEANO, that incorporates graph structure, node attributes and label information.\nSimilar to REMAD, SEANO also aggregates neighbor information to center nodes, and the node representations are obtained through an embedding layer, formulated as:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{SEANO:embedding}\n    z_{i} = \\lambda_{i}h^{l_{1}}(x_{i}) + (1-\\lambda_{i})h^{l_{1}}(\\Bar{x}_{N_{i}}),\n\\end{equation}     \nwhere $z_{i}$ is $i$'s representation, $\\lambda_{i}$ is a trainable variable that identifies the weight of $i$'s own attributes ($x_{i}$), $\\Bar{x}_{N_{i}}$ is the average of node $i$'s neighbors' representations, and the function $h^{k}(x_{i}) = \\phi(W^kh^{k-1}(x_i)+b^k)$ maps original node attributes into lower dimensional vectors.\nThen, a supervised component, which takes the representations as input, predicts node labels through a softmax classifier, and an unsupervised component is trained to reconstruct node contexts (node sequences).\nThe context of each node is not only generated through random walks on the graph but also from the labeled nodes that belong to the same class. After training, SEANO interprets $\\lambda_{i}$ as the normality score of node $i$ and the top-k nodes with the highest scores are classed as anomalies.\nLearning node representations via aggregating neighbor information has proven effective for capturing comprehensive information from graph structure and node attributes. \nBut, Liu \\etal~ demonstrated such an approach can help anomalies aggregate features from regular nodes, making them look normal and leading to sub-optimal detection performance. \nThey identified three concrete issues that should be considered when applying aggregation operations for anomaly detection: \n1) Anomalies are rare objects in a network. Hence, directly aggregating neighborhood information will smooth the difference between the anomalies and normal instances, blurring boundaries between them. \n2) Directly connected nodes have distinctive features, and the assumption that connected nodes share similar features, which serves as the basis for feature aggregation, no longer holds in this scenario.\n3) Real objects also form multiple types of relations with others, which means aggregation results for different types of relations will be distinctive.\nWith regard to these concerns, their proposed method, GraphConsis, follows a sampling strategy to avoid potential anomalous neighbors when aggregating node features.\nThis method also adopts an attention mechanism to aggregate neighbor information following different links.\nThe learned node representations, therefore, are more robust to anomalies. As such, GraphConsis takes them as input to train a classifier for predicting labels.\nDou \\etal~ further considered camouflage behaviors of fraudsters in their proposed model CARE-GNN to enhance detection performance.\nAs specified, the camouflages can be categorized as either feature camouflage or relation camouflage.\nRespectively, anomalies either adjust their feature information or form connections with many benign objects to gloss over suspicious information.\nHence, directly employing aggregation will overlook the camouflages and smooth the abnormal patterns of anomalies, eliminating the distinctions between anomalies and normal objects. \nTo alleviate over-smoothness, CARE-GNN also adopts a neighbor sampling strategy, as is the case with GraphConsis, to filter camouflaged anomalies and explores different types of relations formed between users.\nSpecifically, under each relation, Dou \\etal employed a MLP to predict node labels using their features and measure the similarity ($l1$ distance) between each node and its neighbors according to the MLP's output.\nThen, the top-k most similar neighbors are selected for feature aggregation, and CARE-GNN generates each node's representation through a combination of latent representations that are learned under different relations.\nA classifier is eventually trained using the representations to predict the node labels.\nAs can be seen, the performance of these network representation based techniques is decided by their training objectives/loss functions.\nEnhanced detection performance is probable if the loss function is able to separate normal nodes from abnormal nodes reasonably well. \nMotivated by this, a more recent work in~ emphasizes the importance of anomaly-aware loss functions.\nIn order to adjust margins for the anomalies, the authors proposed a novel loss function to guide the representation learning process.\nSpecifically, this loss function is designed to find the relative scales between the margins of outlier nodes and normal nodes.\nAn MLP-based classifier is finally trained using the node representations generated by the anomaly-aware loss-guided GNNs and node labels. \nFor unseen nodes, the classifier will label them upon their representations.", "cites": [6286, 6298, 6271], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 4.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes key techniques from multiple papers (REMAD, SEANO, GraphConsis, CARE-GNN) and connects their design choices and innovations in a coherent narrative.
