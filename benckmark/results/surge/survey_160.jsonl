That is, we suppose that the agents being allocated resources, and the resources\nbeing allocated to these agents are all known and fixed.\nBut practical reality is often quite different . Fair\ndivision problems are often online, with either the agents, or \nthe resources to be allocated, or both not being fixed\nand potentially changing over time. \nThis presents a number\nof technical challenges and opportunities. \nConsider allocating deceased organs to patients, donated food to charities, electric vehicles to charging stations, viewing slots to a telescope, etc. We often cannot wait till all resources are available, preferences known or agents present before starting to allocate the\nresources. For example, when a kidney is donated, it must be allocated\nto a patient within a few hours. As a second example, when food items \narrive at a food bank, they must be allocated to charities promptly. \nAs a third example,\nwhen allocating charging slots to electric cars, we may\nnot know when or where cars will arrive for charging in the future\nbut must commit to providing charging slots to cars now. \nAs a fourth example, when allocating landing slots at an airport for\nthe next hour, there might be considerable uncertainty about \nthe demands in six hours time. As a fifth example,\nwhen scheduling viewing slots on an expensive telescope, \nwe might need to commit to the current period, \nbefore future viewing conditions and demands are fully known. \nThe {\\em online} nature of such fair division problems\nchanges {\\em the mechanisms} available to \nallocate items. For example, consider the well-known and widely used \\emph{sequential allocation} mechanism\nstudied in .\nThis mechanism has agents taking turns to pick\ntheir most preferred remaining item. \nThis is used in many offline settings due to \nits simplicity and nice normative properties. For instance,\nit can be used to return allocations where an agent's envy for the allocation of another agent is limited to at most one item. \nHowever, this mechanism cannot be used in an online setting as\nan agent's most preferred item may\nnot be currently (or even ever) available. We, therefore, need\nto develop new {\\em online} mechanisms that account for the fact that some items might never become available.\nThe {\\em online} nature of such fair division problems\nalso changes {\\em the normative properties} that we might look\nto demand. For example,  suppose we are interested in \\emph{strategy-proof} mechanisms\nthat encourage agents to report their sincere preferences. \nIn deciding if agents have any incentive\nto misreport preferences in an online\nsetting, we may take into account the online nature\nof the problem, and thus consider fixed past decisions and unknown future. This leads to\nan {\\em online} and weaker form of strategy-proofness.\nIt is weaker because agents have committed to\ntheir past decisions and uncertainty about\nthe future reduces their strategic options. On the plus side,\nthis means that\nit may be easier to achieve strategy-proofness in the\nonline setting than in the offline setting. \nOn the minus side, this also means that\nit could be harder in the online\nsetting to achieve other properties. \nFor instance, items that arrive in the future may\nrequire us to change the allocation of items \nmade in the present to ensure Pareto efficiency.", "cites": [4102, 8730, 4100, 4101], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5555555555555556, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes the cited papers by using them to support a discussion on the limitations and adaptations of sequential allocation in online fair division, particularly in terms of strategy-proofness and social welfare.

We, therefore, often need to ``flip'' mechanisms\naround to work in an online fashion.\nMany mechanisms for the offline fair division \nof indivisible items take an agent-centered view\nwhere one or more agents get to pick an item or items from a set of items. \nFor example, in offline fair division, the probabilistic \nserial mechanism  has \nevery agent ``eating'' their most preferred item\nat uniform speed, generating a randomized\nallocation of items to agents. \nSuch offline mechanisms need to be adapted\nto work in an online setting as an agent's \nmost preferred item might not be currently, or even ever\navailable. \nAn online setting where items arrive over time\nalso naturally invites an item-centric view. \nFor example,  propose\nthe \\mylike\\ mechanism where\nan item on arrival is allocated \nuniformly at random between agents\nthat declare strictly positive utility\nfor the item. This online mechanism\nhas nice normative properties. \nFor example, it is\nstrategy-proof and envy-free in expectation.\nThe \\mylike\\ mechanism can be seen as the online analog of the\n(offline) {probabilistic serial} mechanism\nwith agents ``eating'' each next item which they like.\nMany other online mechanisms for the fair division of indivisible items can \nbe described as choosing uniformly between some subset of agents that are feasible\nfor an arriving item. Thus, an agent from this set receives the\nitem with \\emph{conditional probability} that is uniform with respect\nto the other agents that are feasible for\nthe item. Such mechanisms return a probability distribution\nover allocations,\nand an actual allocation with some positive probability that is\nobtained as a product of \nthe conditional randomizations. Some such mechanisms are studied in :\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\myosd: there is a strict priority order $\\sigma$ of the agents\n  prior to round one, and the unique feasible agent for each next item is the first agent in $\\sigma$ that bids positively for it.\n\\item \\myorp: this draws uniformly at random a strict priority order $\\sigma$ of the agents prior to round one, and runs \\myosd\\ with it. \n\\item \\mypar: an agent is feasible for an item if allocating the item\n  to the agent is Pareto efficient ex post. \n\\item \\mylike: an agent is feasible for an item if they bid positively\n  for it. \n\\item \\myblike: an agent is feasible for an item if they bid positively\n  for it, and they are amongst the agents bidding positively with the\n  fewest\nitems in the current allocation. \n\\item \\mymax: an agent is feasible for an item if they are amongst the\n  agents making the largest bid for it. \n\\end{itemize}\nIt should be clear that the online setting introduces a new design\nspace in which to define mechanisms for fair division.
