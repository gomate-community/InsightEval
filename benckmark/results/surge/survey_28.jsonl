However, it is only after the 21st century that advanced scientific tools were primarily developed upon real-world data . Since 2002 , Girvan and Newman opened a new direction with graph partition. In the past ten years, researchers from computer science have extensively studied community detection  by utilizing network topological structures  and semantic information  for both static and dynamic networks  and small and large networks . Graph-based approaches are developed increasingly to detect communities in environments with complex data structures . Network dynamics and community impacts can be analyzed in details within community detection, such as rumor spread, virus outbreak, and tumour evolution.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\subfigure[graph]{\\includegraphics[width=0.19\\textwidth]{figure/osn.pdf}} \\hfill\n\\subfigure[communities]{\\includegraphics[width=0.27\\textwidth]{figure/osnc.pdf}} \n\\caption{\\footnotesize (a) An illustration of a graph where nodes denote users in a social network. (b) An illustration of two communities ($C_1$ and $C_2$) based on the prediction of users' occupations. The detection utilizes users' closeness in online activities (topology) and account profiles (attributes). }\n\\label{fig-osn}\n\\end{figure}\nCommunity detection is a research area with increasing practical significance. As the saying goes, \\textit{Birds of a feather flock together} . Based on the theory of \\textit{Six Degrees of Separation}, any person in the world can know anyone else through six acquaintances . Indeed, our world is a vast network formed by a series of communities. For example, in social networks (Fig. \\ref{fig-osn}), platform sponsors promote products to targeted users in detected communities   . Community detection in citation networks  determines the importance, interconnectedness, evolution of research topics and identifies research trends. In metabolic networks  and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks , community detection reveals the complexities of metabolisms and proteins with similar biological functions. Similarly, community detection in brain networks  reflects the functional and anatomical segregation of brain regions.\nMany traditional techniques, such as spectral clustering  and statistical inference , are applied to small networks and simple cases. However, real-world networks in rich nonlinear information make traditional models less applicable to practical applications, including complex topology and high dimensional features. Their computational costs are expensive. The powerful techniques of \\textbf{deep learning} offer flexible solutions with good community detection performance to: (1) learn nonlinear network properties, such as relations denoting edges between nodes, (2) represent lower-dimensional network embeddings preserving the complicated network structure, and (3) achieve better community detection from various information. Therefore, deep learning for community detection is a new trend that demands a timely comprehensive survey\\footnote{This paper is an extended vision of our published survey  in IJCAI-20, which is the first published work on the review of community detection approaches with deep learning.}. \nTo the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey focusing on deep learning contributions in community detection. In discovering inherent patterns and functions , existing surveys mainly focused on community detection on \\textit{specific techniques} , \\textit{different network types} , \\textit{community types} , and \\textit{application scenarios} . The surveys on \\textit{specific techniques} are summarized but not limited to partial detection based on probabilistic graphical models , Label Propagation Algorithm (LPAs) , and evolutionary computation for single- and multi-objective optimizations . In terms of different \\textit{network types}, researchers provide overviews on dynamic networks , directed networks  and multi-layer networks . Moreover, detection techniques are reviewed over disjoint and overlapping  \\textit{community types}. Regarding \\textit{application scenarios}, the focus has been on techniques on social networks .\nObserving the past, current and future trends, this paper aims to support researchers and practitioners to understand the community detection field with respect to:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Systematic Taxonomy and Comprehensive Review.} We propose a new systematic taxonomy for this survey (see Fig. \\ref{fig-taxonomy}). For each category, we review, summarize and compare the representative works. We also briefly introduce community detection applications in the real world.

Fig. \\ref{fig-timeline} illustrates its development from traditional to deep learning in a timeline. Their respective categories are summarized in Fig. \\ref{fig-taxonomy} in the left and right parts, respectively. Two categories of methods suggest the development changes. Traditional methods mainly explore communities from network structures. We briefly review these seven categories of methods in this section. Deep learning uncovers deep network information and models complex relationships from high-dimensional data to lower-dimensional vectors. These will be reviewed in the following sections.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Graph Partition.} These methods, well known as graph clustering , are employed in deep learning models. They partition a network into communities with a given number $K$. Kernighan-Lin  is a representative heuristic algorithm. It initially divides a network into two arbitrary subgraphs and optimizes on nodes. Spectral bisection  is another representative method applying spectrum Laplacian matrix.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Statistical Inference.} Stochastic Block Model (SBM)  is a widely applied generative model by assigning nodes into communities and controlling their probabilities of likelihood. The variants include Degree-Corrected SBM (DCSBM)  and Mixed Membership SBM (MMB) .\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Hierarchical Clustering.} This group of methods discover hierarchical community structures (\\textit{i.e.}, dendrogram) in three ways: divisive, agglomerative and hybrid. The Girvan-Newman (GN) algorithm finds community structure in a divisive way by successively removing edges such that a new community occurs . Fast Modularity (Fast\\textit{Q}) , an agglomerative algorithm, gradually merges nodes, each of which is initially regarded as a community. Community Detection Algorithm based on Structural Similarity (CDASS)  jointly applies divisive and agglomerative strategies in a hybrid way. \n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Dynamical Methods.} Random walks are utilized to detect communities dynamically. For example, the random walk in WalkTrap  calculates node distances and the probability of community membership. Information Mapping (InfoMap)  applies the minimal-length encoding. Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA)  identifies diffusion communities through an information propagation mechanism. \n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Spectral Clustering.} The network spectra reflects the community structure. Spectral clustering  partitions the network on the normalized Laplacian matrix and the regularized adjacency matrix, and fits SBM in the pseudo-likelihood algorithm. On the spectra of normalized Laplacian matrices, Siemon \\textit{et al.} integrated communities in macroscopic and microscopic neural brain networks to obtain clusters.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Density-based Algorithms.} Significant clustering algorithms include Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) , Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks (SCAN)  and Locating Structural Centers for Community Detection (LCCD) . They identify communities, hubs and outliers by measuring entities' density. \n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{figure/cnn.pdf}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize A general framework for CNN-based community detection with details in Section \\ref{sec-model-cnn}. As Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) input, the graph is preprocessed into the image data on nodes or edges. The $d$-dimensional latent features are convolutionally mapped within multiple CNN hidden layers and a final fully connected layer outputs representations of each node or each edge for classifications. Focusing on nodes, the flow \\ding{172} predicts community labels in $k$ classes that nodes with same labels are clustered into a community. Focusing on edges, the flow \\ding{173} predicts edge labels in two classes, \\textit{i.e.}, inner and inter. The preliminary communities are formed by removing inter-community edges and optimized by merging with a measurement such as Modularity $Q$.} \\label{fig-cnn}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Optimizations.} Community detection generally maximizes the likelihood. Modularity (\\textit{Q})  is the most classic optimization function following its variant Fast\\textit{Q} . Louvain  is another well-known optimization algorithm that employs the node-moving strategy on optimized modularity. Moreover, the extensions of greedy optimizations include simulated annealing , extremal optimization  and spectral optimization . Effective in local and global searching , the evolutionary optimizations consist of single and multiple objectives. For example, Multi-Agent Genetic Algorithm (MAGA-Net)  applies a single modularity function. Combo  mixes Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)  and Conductance (CON) . \\textit{Q}, NMI and CON estimate the network partition quality with details in APPENDIX \\ref{sec-EM}.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Why community detection needs deep learning?} Capturing information from connections in a straightforward way may lead to sub-optimal community detection results. Deep learning models  bring the following additional advantages to community detection. Thus, deep learning-based community detection has been a new emerging branch. Its general framework learns lower-dimensional vectors from high-dimensional data of complex structural relationships . It, therefore, enables knowledge discoveries via the state-of-the-art machine learning and data mining techniques. The framework with representations can further embed non-structural features, such as node attributes, to increase the knowledge of community memberships . Besides, groups of information from nodes , edges , neighborhoods  or multi-graphs  can be jointly recognized with special attentions in the deep learning process, leading to effective community detection results. With the deep learning ability to big data, more and more large-scale , high-sparse , complex structural , dynamic  networks in real-world scenarios can be explored. Along with the achievements in a relatively short time (in Fig. \\ref{fig-timeline}), the development of community detection within the deep learning domain keeps facing a series of challenges. In this paper, we review accomplishments in Sections \\ref{sec-model-cn}--\\ref{sec-application}, and point out opportunities and challenges in Section \\ref{sec-future}.", "cites": [6530, 6534, 6533, 9039, 8488, 8483, 6532, 9150, 8487, 8564, 9037, 9116, 9042, 166, 9043, 9040, 9041, 1430], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4090909090909091, "origin_cites_number": 44, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.3}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a factual summary of traditional community detection methods and briefly introduces the motivation for deep learning.

{"id": "afcc3bd7-a99a-4b39-826e-c7d51c2ce4ca", "title": "GCN-based Community Detection", "level": "subsection", "subsections": [], "parent_id": "53179a86-3ef2-45d1-a6a6-5ebd937b3b6c", "prefix_titles": [["title", "A Comprehensive Survey on Community Detection with Deep Learning"], ["section", "Convolutional Network-based Community Detection"], ["subsection", "GCN-based Community Detection"]], "content": "\\label{sec-model-gcn}\nGCNs aggregate node neighborhood's information in deep graph convolutional layers to globally capture complex features for community detection (Fig. \\ref{fig-gcn}). There are two classes of community detection methods based on GCNs: (1) supervised/semi-supervised community classification, and (2) community clustering with unsupervised network representation. Community classification methods are limited by a lack of labels in the real world. In comparison, network representations are more flexible to cluster communities through techniques such as matrix reconstructions and objective optimizations. TABLE \\ref{table-gcn} in APPENDIX \\ref{sec-stdlcd} compares the techniques.\nGCNs employ a few traditional community detection methods as deep graph operators, such as SBMs for statistical inference, Laplacian matrix for spectrum analysis and probabilistic graphical models for belief propagation. For example, Line Graph Neural Network (LGNN)  is a supervised community detection model, which improves SBMs with better community detection performance and reduces the computational cost. Integrating the non-backtracking operator with belief propagation's message-passing rules, LGNN learns node represented features in directed networks. The softmax function identifies conditional probabilities that a node $v_i$ belongs to the community $C_k$ ($o_{i,k} = p(y_i=c_k|\\Theta,\\mathcal{G}$), and minimizes the cross-entropy loss over all possible permutations $S_{\\mathcal{C}}$ of community labels:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L}(\\Theta)=\\min_{\\pi \\in S_{\\mathcal{C}}}{-\\sum\\nolimits_i\\log{o_{i, \\pi(y_{i})}}}.\n\\end{equation}\nSince GCN is not initially designed for the community detection task, community structures are not the focus in learning node embeddings. To meet this gap, a semi-supervised GCN community detection model, named MRFasGCN, characterizes hidden communities through extending the network-specific Markov Random Field as a new convolutional layer (eMRF) which makes MRFasGCN community oriented and performs a smooth refinement to the coarse results from GCN. To enable unsupervised community detection, the GCN-based framework, denoted as SGCN , designs a local label sampling model to locate the structural centers for community detection. By integrating the label sampling model with GCN, SGCN encodes both network topology and node attributes in the training of each node's community membership without any prior label information. \nIn terms of a probabilistic inference framework, detecting overlapping communities can be solved by a generative model inferring the community affiliations of nodes. For example, Neural Overlapping Community Detection (NOCD)  combines the Bernoulli–Poisson (BP) probabilistic model and a two-layer GCN to learn community affiliation vectors by minimizing BP's negative log-likelihood. By setting a threshold to keep recognizing and removing weak affiliations, final communities are obtained.\nSpectral GCNs represent all latent features from the node's neighborhood. The features of neighboring nodes converge to the same values by repeatedly operating Laplacian smoothing in deep GCN layers. However, these models lead to an over-smoothing problem in community detection. To reduce the negative impact, Graph Convolutional Ladder-shape Networks (GCLN)  is designed as a new GCN architecture for unsupervised community detection ($k$-means), which is based on the U-Net in the CNN field. A contracting path and an expanding path are built symmetrically in GCLN. The contextual features captured from the contracting path fuse with the localized information learned in the expanding path. The layer-wise propagation follows Eq. (\\ref{equ-gcn}).\nSince different types of connections are generally treated as plain edges, GCNs represent each type of connection and aggregate them, leading to redundant representations. Independence Promoted Graph Disentangled Network (IPGDN)  distinguishes the neighborhood into different parts and automatically discovers the nuances of a graph's independent latent features to reduce the difficulty in detecting communities. IPGDN is supported by Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) regularization  in neighborhood routings.\nFor attributed graphs, community detection by GCNs relies on both structural information and attributed features, where neighboring nodes and the nodes with similar features are likely to cluster in the same community. Therefore, graph convolutions multiply the above two graph signals and need to filter out high-frequency noises smoothly. To this end, a low-pass filter is embedded in Adaptive Graph Convolution (AGC)  with spectral clustering through:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\np(\\lambda_q) = (1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda_q)^k,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the frequency response function of $\\mathcal{G}$ denotes $p(\\Lambda)=\\text{diag}\\left(p\\left(\\lambda_1\\right),\\cdots,p\\left(\\lambda_n\\right)\\right)$ decreasing and nonnegative on all eigenvalues. AGC convolutionally selects suitable neighborhood hop sizes in $k$ and represents graph features by the $k$-order graph convolution as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\bar{\\bm{X}} = (I - \\frac{1}{2}\\bm{L}_s)^k\\bm{X}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\bm{L}_s$ denotes the symmetrically normalized graph Laplacian on $\\lambda_q$. The filter smooths the node embedding $\\bar{\\bm{X}}$ adjusting to $k$ that higher $k$ leads to better filtering performance.\nAdaptive Graph Encoder (AGE)  is another smoothing filter model scalable to community detection. AGE adaptively performs node similarity measurement ($\\bm{S} = \\left[s_{ij}\\right]$) and $t$-stacked Laplacian smoothing filters ($\\bar{\\bm{X}} = (\\bm{I} - \\gamma \\bm{L})^t \\bm{X}$):\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum\\nolimits_{(v_i,v_j)\\in V'} -s'_{ij}\\log(s_{ij}) - (1-s'_{ij})\\log(1 - s_{ij}),  \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $V'$ denotes balanced training set over positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) samples, $s'_{ij}$ is the ranked binary similarity label on node pairs $(v_i,v_j)$.\nA few works make significant contributions to GCN's filters. For example, Graph Convolutional Neural Networks with Cayley Polynomials (CayleyNets) , in a spectral graph convolution architecture, proposes an effective Cayley filter for high-order approximation on community detection. It specializes in narrow-band filtering since low frequencies contain extensive community information for community detection-aimed representations. Cooperating with the Cayley filter, CayleyNets involves a mean pooling in spectral convolutional layers and a semi-supervised softmax classifier on nodes for community membership prediction. \nTo capture the global cluster structure for community detection, the Spectral Embedding Network for attributed graph clustering (SENet)  introduces the loss of spectral clustering into a three-layer GCN's output layer by minimizing: \n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L} = -\\operatorname{tr}((\\bm{H}^{(3)})^{\\top} \\bm{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\bm{K} \\bm{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\bm{H}^{(3)}), \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\bm{K}$ is a kernel matrix encoding typologies and attributes. \nCommunity Deep Graph Infomax (CommDGI)  jointly optimizes graph representations and clustering through Mutual Information (MI) on nodes and communities, and measures graph modularity for maximization. It applies contrastive training to obtain better representations, $k$-means for node clustering and targets cluster centers. Zhao \\textit{et al.}  proposed a graph debiased contrastive learning which simultaneously performs representations and clustering so that the clustering results and discriminative representations are both improved.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{figure/gat.pdf}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize A general framework for GAT-based community detection with details in Section \\ref{sec-model-gat}.

In community detection (Fig. \\ref{fig-gat}), the attention mechanism contributes to adaptively learning the importance of each node in a neighborhood. Correlations between similar nodes are computed close to the ground truth of community membership, which is inherited in GAT's representations. These attentions filter spatial relations or integrate metapaths. Therefore, communities in attributed, multiplex, heterogeneous networks can be easily detected (TABLE \\ref{table-gat}).\nThe relations need special attention in deep community detection models. For example, citations and co-subject relationships are both significant in clustering papers into research topics. The multiplex network is constructed by multiple relation types reflected on edges (\\textit{i.e.}, $E^{(r)}$). Each type of edges is grouped in a layer $r$. Thus, GATs can pay attentions to relation types. Deep Graph Infomax for attributed Multiplex network embedding (DMGI)  independently embeds each relation type and computes network embeddings in maximizing the globally shared features to detect communities. Its contrastive learning conducts between the original network and a corrupted network on each layer through the discriminator. A consensus regularization is subsequently applied with the attention coefficient to integrate final embeddings. The benefit of applying the attention mechanism is to preprocess the less significant relations by weakening their coefficient, especially when various types of relations are presented.\nDespite the extrinsic supervision signal sharing globally in multiple relations, DMGI cannot capture the intrinsic signal into node embeddings where node attributes are considered. To fill the gap, High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI)  is developed to capture both signals and their interactions. HDMI further designs a fusion module for the node embedding combination over multiplex network layers based on the semantic attention  on community memberships. \nHeterogeneous Information Network (HIN) involves diverse types of nodes $\\mathcal{V}$ and edges $\\mathcal{E}$. Deep community detection over heterogeneous networks represents heterogeneous typologies and attributes $\\mathcal{X}$. Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN)  offers a superior community detection solution by multi-informative semantic metapaths which distinguish heterogeneous structures in graph attention layers. MAGNN generates node attributes from semantic information. Since heterogeneous nodes and edges exist in intra- and inter-metapaths, MAGNN utilizes the attention mechanism in both of their embeddings by aggregating semantic variances over nodes and metapaths. Thus, MAGNN reduces the high heterogeneity and embeds richer topological and semantic information to enhance community detection results. Moreover, HeCo  embeds network schema and metapaths from HINs. A modified contrastive learning is employed to guide two parts of embeddings. Sequentially, the attention mechanism acts on node importance, network heterogeneity and semantic features, where community detection benefits.\nThe above two works both use metapaths to facilitate community detection, but defining meaningful metapaths requires lots of domain knowledge. Thus, Context Path-based Graph Neural Network (CP-GNN)  is built to learn node embeddings by context paths where attention mechanisms are exploited to discriminate the importance of different relationships. The non-predefined context paths are significant in capturing the high-order relationship for community detection. \n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{figure/gan.pdf}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize A general framework for GAN-based community detection with details in Section \\ref{sec-model-gan}.

The discriminator adopts Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) to modify generated communities with the ground truth of community labels. The locator is designed to provide regularization signals to the generator, so that irrelevant nodes in community detection can be eliminated.\nTo imbalanced communities, Dual-Regularized Graph Convolutional Networks (DR-GCN)  utilizes a conditional GAN into the dual-regularized GCN model, \\textit{i.e.}, a latent distribution alignment regularization and a class-conditioned adversarial regularization.

The second regularization is designed to distinguish communities on labeled node representations:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{\\phi_{g}, \\mathcal{L}} &\\max_{\\phi_{d}} \\mathcal{L}(\\phi_{d}, \\phi_{g}) = \\mathbb{E}_{v_{i} \\sim p_{data}(v_{i})} \\log \\phi_{d}(v_{i} |y_{i}) \\\\\n& +\\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{z} \\sim p_{\\bm{z}}(\\bm{z})} [\\log(1-\\phi_{d}(\\phi_{g}(\\bm{z} |y_{i}))) + \\mathcal{L}_{reg}], \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \\sum_{u \\in N(v_{i})} \\| \\bm{h}_{v'_{i}} - \\bm{h}_{u} \\|_2$ forces the generated fake node $v'_{i}$ to reconstruct the respective neighborhood relations (as $u \\sim v_{i}$), $y_{i}$ is the ground truth label of node $v_{i}$. \nInstead of generating only one kind of fake samples, Jointly Adversarial Network Embedding (JANE)  employs two network information of topology and node attributes to capture semantic variations from adversarial groups of real and fake samples. Specifically, JANE represents embeddings $\\bm{H}$ through a multi-head self-attention encoder $\\phi_e$, where Gaussian noises are added for fake features for competition over the generator $\\phi_g$ and the discriminator $\\phi_d$:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{\\phi_g,\\phi_e} \\max_{\\phi_d} & {\\mathcal{L} (\\phi_d, \\phi_e, \\phi_g)}\n= \\\\\n&\\mathbb{E}_{(\\bm{a}, \\bm{x}) \\sim p_{\\bm{AX}}}[\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{h} \\sim p_{\\phi_e}(\\cdot |\\bm{a}, \\bm{x})}[\\log \\phi_d(\\bm{h}, \\bm{a}, \\bm{x})]}_{\\log \\phi_d(\\phi_e(\\bm{a}, \\bm{x}), \\bm{a}, \\bm{x})}] \\\\\n+& \\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{h} \\sim p_{\\bm{H}}}[\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{(\\bm{a}, \\bm{x}) \\sim p_{\\phi_g}(\\cdot |\\bm{h})}[\\log (1-\\phi_d(\\bm{h}, \\bm{a}, \\bm{x}))]}_{\\log (1-\\phi_d(\\bm{h}, \\phi_g(\\bm{h})))}], \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $p_{\\bm{AX}}$ denotes the joint distribution of the topology $\\bm{A}$ ($\\bm{a} \\subseteq \\bm{A}$) and sampled node attributes $\\bm{X}$ ($\\bm{x} \\subseteq \\bm{X}$).\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\centering \\footnotesize\n\\subfigure[\\footnotesize A general framework of AE-based community detection]{\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{figure/AE-a-framework.pdf}}\n\\subfigure[\\footnotesize static unattributed graph]{\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth]{figure/AE-b-unattributed_static.pdf}} \n\\subfigure[\\footnotesize static attributed graph]{\\includegraphics[width=0.27\\textwidth]{figure/AE-c-attributed.pdf}} \n\\subfigure[\\footnotesize dynamic graph]{\\includegraphics[width=0.26\\textwidth]{figure/AE-d-dynamic.pdf}} \n\\subfigure[\\footnotesize cross-domain graph]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{figure/AE-e-cross-domain.pdf}} \n\\subfigure[\\footnotesize heterogeneous graph]{\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\textwidth]{figure/AE-f-heterogeneous.pdf}}\n\\subfigure[\\footnotesize attributed multi-view graph]{\\includegraphics[width=0.41\\textwidth]{figure/AE-g-multi_view.pdf}} \n\\caption{\\footnotesize A general framework for AE-based community detection consists of (a) the framework of the input layer, AE and clustering layers and the output layer and (b)-(g) AE-based community detection processes for each type of graph: (a) The input can be one of the graphs. They have topology and attributes information which are represented by the adjacency matrix $\\bm{A}$ (\\ding{172}-\\ding{174}, \\ding{177}), node attribute vectors $\\bm{X}$ (\\ding{173}, \\ding{177}), node similarity matrix $\\bm{S}$ (\\ding{175}) and metapaths $\\Phi$ (\\ding{176}). More than one AE can be included that each AE embeds a part of input. Two optional work flows representively output node embeddings $\\bm{H}_v$ and community membership matrix $\\bm{H}_c$ for community detection results (\\textit{i.e.}, the AE output layer). (b) Inputting typologies $\\bm{A}$, the AE outputs node embeddings $\\bm{H}_{v}$ by minimizing the reconstruction loss $\\mathcal{L}_{re}$ (solid arrows) or outputs the community membership matrix $\\bm{H}_{c}$ by further minimizing the clustering loss over $\\bm{P}$ and $\\bm{Q}$ distributions which measures node's probability in a community (dashed arrows). The community prior information for $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{O},\\bm{H})$ (dashed arrows) or the sparse penalty for $\\Omega(\\rho\\|\\sum{\\bm{h}_{i}/n})$ (dashed arrows) optionally guides AE learning upon hidden layer embeddings $\\bm{h}_{i} \\in \\bm{H}$. (c) Aiming at $\\bm{H}_{v}$ or $\\bm{H}_{c}$, typologies $\\bm{A}$ and node attributes $\\bm{X}$ are respectively represented by AE1 and AE2 (solid arrows). Their embeddings $\\bm{H}_{\\bm{A}}$ and $\\bm{H}_{\\bm{X}}$ are aggregated by minimizing the consistency loss. Otherwise (dashed arrows), an AE embeds all input over $(\\bm{A},\\bm{X})$. (d) The $t$-th snapshot $\\bm{A}_{(t)}$ in the dynamic graph is represented for the node embeddings $\\bm{H}_{(t)}$. The temporal smoothness regularization optimizes $\\bm{H}_{(t)}$ over the previous snapshot's embeddings. $\\bm{O}$ is optionally employed. (e) Two AEs respectively represent similarity matrices from the source and target domains into $\\bm{H}_{s}$ and $\\bm{H}_{t}$ where $\\bm{H}_{s}$ guides AE2's training and node embeddings of the target graph $\\bm{H}_{t}$ is outputted. (f) Each metapath is represented in an AE with the input feature vectors $\\{\\bm{x}_{i\\Phi}\\}$ denoting the meta proximity $\\bm{p}_{i} \\in \\bm{P}$ between node $v_{i}$ in the metapath $\\Phi$. All metapaths' embeddings are aggregated for $\\bm{H}_{v}$ in the fully connected layer in these stacked AEs. (g) Attributes in each view are input with $A$ into an AE where node embeddings in different views are optimized by the clustering loss.}\n\\label{fig-stacked-ae}\n\\end{figure*}\nThe proximity can capture underlying relationships within communities. However, sparsely connected networks in the real world do not provide enough edges. Attributes in networks cannot be measured by proximity. To address these limitations, Proximity Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN)  encodes each node's proximity from a set of instantiated triplets, so that community relationships are discovered and preserved in a low-dimensional space.\nCommunity Detection with Generative Adversarial Nets (CommunityGAN)  is proposed for overlapping communities, which obtains node representation by assigning each node-community pair a nonnegative factor. Its objective function optimizes through a motif-level generator $\\phi_g(\\cdot|v_i;\\Theta_g)$ and discriminator $\\phi_d(\\cdot,\\Theta_d)$: \n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{\\Theta_g} \\max_{\\Theta_d} & {\\mathcal{L}(\\phi_g, \\phi_d)} =\n\\sum_i (\\mathbb{E}_{C' \\sim p_{true} (\\cdot |v_{i})} \\left[ \\log \\phi_d (C'; \\Theta_d) \\right] \\\\\n& + \\mathbb{E}_{V' \\sim \\phi_g(V' |v_i ; \\Theta_g)} \\left[ \\log (1-\\phi_d(V'; \\Theta_d) \\right] ), \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\Theta_g$ and $\\Theta_d$ unifies all nonnegative representation vector of node $v_i$ in the generator and the discriminator, $V'\\subseteq V$ denotes a node subset, $C'$ represents motifs (\\textit{i.e.}, cliques), and conditional probability $p_{true}(C'| v_i)$ describes the preference distribution of $C'$ covering $v_i$ over all other motifs $C'\\in \\mathcal{C'}$. \nTo capture the global structural information, Community-Aware Network Embedding (CANE)  integrates a community detection model, \\textit{i.e.} Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), into the adversarial node representation process: \n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{\\Theta_g} & \\max_{\\Theta_d}  {\\mathcal{L}(\\phi_g, \\phi_d)} = \\\\\n\\sum_i & (\\mathbb{E}_{v \\sim p_{true} (v |v_{i})} \\left[ \\log \\phi_{d} (v, v_{i}; \\Theta_d) + P_{\\phi}(v |v_{i}) \\right] \\\\\n& + \\mathbb{E}_{v \\sim \\phi_{g}(v |v_{i} ; \\Theta_g)} \\left[ \\log (1-\\phi_{d}(v, v_{i}; \\Theta_d) - P_{\\phi}(v |v_{i}) \\right] ), \n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $P_{\\phi}(v |v_{i})$ indicates the community similarity between a node $v_{i}$ and the node sample $v$, $\\phi_{g}(v |v_{i} ; \\Theta_g)$ outputs the node connectivity distribution. In turn, the representations characterize the community property.\nNetwork Embedding and overlapping Community detection with Adversarial learning (ACNE)  further generates negative communities as fake samples to learn distinguished community representation. ACNE utilizes walking strategy with perception to assist sampling of overlapping communities for nodes and exploits the discriminator to jointly map the node and community membership embeddings, so as to preserve the correlation of node-community in representations.", "cites": [8252], "cite_extract_rate": 0.125, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section describes several GAN-based community detection methods (SEAL, DR-GCN, JANE, and ProGAN) with technical formulations, but lacks a deeper synthesis of their contributions or connections between them.

In this architecture, stacked AEs represent multi-level and dynamic information to flexibly support wide community detection implementations .\nSemi-supervised Nonlinear Reconstruction Algorithm with DNN (semi-DRN)  designs a stacked AE into a community detection model, where a modularity matrix learns the nonlinear node representations in AEs and $k$-means obtains final community structure. Given an edge between nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$ in the adjacency matrix $\\bm{A}=[a_{ij}]$, the modularity  $b_{ij} = a_{ij} - \\frac{k_i k_j}{2m}$ in the modularity matrix $\\bm{B}$ is optimized for maximization. Encoding the node pairwise similarities (community membership) based on node representations, a pairwise constraint matrix $\\bm{O} = [o_{i,j}\\in \\{0,1\\}]$ is, meanwhile, defined to provide a prior knowledge that nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$ belong to the same community ($o_{i,j} = 1$) or not ($o_{i,j} = 0$). Thus, semi-DRN is optimized by minimizing the loss function:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}(\\bm{B}, \\bm{\\hat{B}}) + \\lambda \\mathcal{L}(\\bm{O},\\bm{H}), \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\bm{\\hat{B}}$ represents the reconstructed $\\bm{B}$ over stacked representations by a series of AEs, $\\lambda$ denotes an adjusting weight between the AE reconstruction loss $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{B}, \\bm{\\hat{B}})$ and the pairwise constraints $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{O},\\bm{H})$, and $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{O},\\bm{H})$ measures each pair of community membership $o_{ij}$ and latent representations $(\\bm{h}_i,\\bm{h}_j)$ within stacked AEs. \nSimilarly, Deep Network Embedding with Structural Balance Preservation (DNE-SBP)  incorporates the adjusting weight on pairwise constraints for signed networks so that the stacked AE clusters the closest nodes distinguished by positive and negative connections. Unified Weight-free Multi-component Network Embedding (UWMNE) and its variant with Local Enhancement (WMCNE-LE)  preserve community properties from network topology and semantic information and integrate the diverse information in deep AE from a local network structure perspective.\nTo discover $t$ time-varying community structure, Semi-supervised Evolutionary Autoencoder (sE-Autoencoder)  is developed within an evolutionary clustering framework, assuming community structures at previous time steps successively guide the detection at the current time step. To this end, sE-Autoencoder adds a temporal smoothness regularization $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{H}_{(t)}, \\bm{H}_{(t-1)})$ for minimization  in:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}(\\bm{S}_{(t)}, \\bm{\\hat{S}}_{(t)})+ \\lambda \\mathcal{L}(\\bm{O}, \\bm{H}_{(t)}) + (1-\\lambda) \\mathcal{L}(\\bm{H}_{(t)}, \\bm{H}_{(t-1)}),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere reconstruction error $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{S}_{(t)}, \\bm{\\hat{S}}_{(t)})$ minimizes the loss between the similarity matrix $\\bm{S}_{(t)}$ and reconstructed matrix $\\bm{\\hat{S}}_{(t)}$ at the time step $t$, and the parameter $\\lambda$ controls the node pairwise constraint $\\mathcal{L}(\\bm{O},\\bm{H}_{(t)})$ and the temporal smoothness regularization over time $t$-th graph representation $\\bm{H}_{(t)}$.\nTo attributed networks, Deep Attributed Network Embedding (DANE)  develops a two-branch AE framework: one branch maps the highly nonlinear network structure to the low-dimensional feature space, and the other collaboratively learns node attributes. As similar nodes are more likely to be clustered in the same community, DANE measures these similarities by a series of proximity regarding network topological and attribute information in the representation learning, where optimizations are applied on reconstruction losses at first-order proximity $\\mathcal{L}_f$, higher-order proximity $\\mathcal{L}_h$ and semantic proximity $\\mathcal{L}_s$, and a negative log likelihood control $\\mathcal{L}_c$ for a consistent and complementary representation.\nTo solve the problem of shifted distributions, imbalanced features or a lack of data, Transfer Learning-inspired Community Detection with Deep Transitive Autoencoder (Transfer-CDDTA)  uses the transfer learning framework and modifies it to the unsupervised community detection task. On the source and target domains, Transfer-CDDTA balances stacked AEs via KL divergence while learning node embeddings. Aiming to map community information into one smooth feature space, CDDTA separates the input adjacency matrix $\\bm{A}$ into a source domain $s$ and a target domain $t$ by similarity matrices $\\bm{S}_s$ and $\\bm{S}_t$ to keep node pairwise similarity values for each stacked AE. Transfer-CDDTA then incorporates domain-independent features into the following minimization: \n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_s(\\bm{S}_s, \\bm{\\hat{S}}_s) + \\mathcal{L}_t(\\bm{S}_t, \\bm{\\hat{S}}_t) + \\alpha KL(\\bm{H}_s,\\bm{H}_t)+\\beta\\mathcal{L}(\\Theta; \\gamma),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ are trade-off parameters, $\\mathcal{L}_s$ and $\\mathcal{L}_t$ denote reconstruction losses of source and target domains, $KL$ smooths the KL divergence on encoded features ($\\bm{H}_s$, $\\bm{H}_t$) across two domains, and $\\mathcal{L}(\\Theta)$ is a regularization term on trainable variables to reduce overfitting in the optimization. \nDeep alIgned autoencoder-based eMbEdding (DIME)  stacks AEs for the multiple aligned structures in heterogeneous social networks. It employs metapaths to represent different relations (heterogeneous links denoting $\\mathcal{A}_{ij}$ which represents anchor links between multiple aligned network $\\mathcal{G}_i$ and $\\mathcal{G}_j$) and various attribute information $\\mathcal{X}=\\{\\bm{X}_i\\}$.

It is first introduced into the graph learning field by Variational Graph AutoEncoder (VGAE)  assuming prior distribution and applying GCN as the encoder, through which the learned representation $\\bm{Z}$ is a latent distribution. Community detection based on VAEs is activated by algorithms such as SBM, to fast inference community memberships in node representations . The inference process considers the uncertainty of the network , \\textit{e.g.}, community contradiction between neighbors of boundary nodes connecting multiple communities. VAEs are also required to handle sparsity in detecting communities. Meanwhile, VAEs easily incorporate deeper nonlinear relationship information. For example, Triad (Variational) Graph Autoencoder (TGA/TVGA)  replaces VAE/VGAE's decoder with a new triad decoder, which describes a real-world existing triadic closure property in communities.\nVariational Graph Embedding and Clustering with Laplacian Eigenmaps (VGECLE)  divides the graph representation into mean and covariance while generatively detecting communities, indicating each node's uncertainty of implicit relationships to its actual geographic position. With a Mixture-of-Gaussian prior and a Teacher-Student (T-S) as regularization, VGECLE aims to let the node $v_i$ (student) learn a distribution close to its neighbors' (teacher).\nDeep Generative Latent Feature Relational Model (DGLFRM)  and Ladder Gamma Variational Autoencoder for Graphs (LGVG)  further capture the community membership strength on each node. DGLFRM models the sparse node embeddings by a Beta-Bernoulli process which can detect overlapping communities and infer the number of communities. LGVG is devised to learn the multi-layered and gamma-distributed embeddings so that it detects communities from fine-grained and coarse-grained granularities.\nTo capture the higher-order structural features of communities, Variational Graph Autoencoder for Community Detection (VGAECD)  employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to generalize the network generation process via bringing in a parameter of community assignments. VGAECD defines the joint probability of generative process, it can be detailed as: \\begin{equation}\n\\small\np(\\bm{a}, \\bm{z}, c) = p(\\bm{a} |\\bm{z}) p(\\bm{z} |c) p(c),\n\\end{equation} \nwhere $p(c) = \\pi_{c}$ denotes the prior probability of community $C_c$, $p(\\bm{z} |c)$ is calculated from the Gaussain distribution corresponding to community $C_c$ with the mean $\\mu_c$ and the standard deviation ${\\sigma}_c$ from a GCN layer (\\textit{i.e.}, $\\bm{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_c, {\\sigma}_c^2 \\bm{I})$), and $\\bm{a}$ with the posterior (reconstruction) probability $p(\\bm{a} |\\bm{z})$ is sampled from the multivariate Bernoulli distribution parametrized by $\\mu_x$ that is learned from the decoder on $\\bm{z}$. The variational distribution can be obtained by the overall loss function as: \n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{ELBO}}(\\bm{x}) = \\mathbb{E}_{q(\\bm{z} | \\bm{x}, \\bm{a})}[\\log p(\\bm{x},\\bm{a} | \\bm{z})] - KL[q(c | \\bm{x}) \\| p(c | \\bm{z})],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the first term calculates reconstruction loss, and $KL$ divergence minimizes the clustering loss. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) is maximized to optimize the function. \nThe training progress of VGAECD reveals a favoured treatment for minimizing the reconstruction loss over the community loss, which leads to a sub-optimal community detection result. To resolve it, Optimizing Variational Graph Autoencoder for Community Detection (VGAECD-OPT)  proposes a dual optimization to learn the community-aware latent representation, the ELBO maximization becomes:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{ELBO}}(\\bm{a}) = \\mathbb{E}_{q(\\bm{z}, c | \\bm{a})}[\\log p(\\bm{a} | \\bm{z})] - KL[q(\\bm{z}, c | \\bm{a}) \\| p(\\bm{z}, c)].\n\\end{equation}\nTo the sparsity and noises in the real world, Adversarially Regularized Variational Graph AutoEncoder (ARVGA)  embeds the latent representations $\\bm{Z}$ based on the prior distribution $p_{z}$ under the adversarial AE framework. $\\bm{Z}$ is represented by a variational graph encoder aiming at a robust community detection. Meanwhile, a special discriminator $\\phi_d$ is designed to decide adversarially on $p_{z}$ guided embeddings $\\bm{Z}$ and encodings on real samples $\\phi_g(\\bm{X}, \\bm{A})$:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{\\Theta_g}\\max_{\\Theta_d} & \\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{z} \\sim p_{z}}[\\log \\phi_d(\\bm{Z})]\\\\\n& +\\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{x} \\sim p(\\bm{x})}[\\log (1-\\phi_d(\\phi_g(\\bm{X}, \\bm{A})))].\n\\end{aligned} \n\\end{equation}", "cites": [6541, 229, 232, 5680, 6542], "cite_extract_rate": 0.625, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple VAE-based community detection approaches, linking concepts such as generative processes, latent distributions, and decoders to form a coherent narrative.

The high sparse input $\\bm{A}$ with many $0$ elements is represented into lower-dimensional feature vectors $\\bm{h}_i$ with non-zero values. To explore deeper information such as community membership, Deep SF (DSF) stacks multiple hidden layers to finetune hyperparameters $\\Theta$ and extensively smooth data distributions $Pr(\\bm{h}_i)$.\nAs a representative method, Community Discovery based on Deep Sparse Filtering (DSFCD)  is developed on three phases: network representation, community feature mapping and community discovery. The network representation phase performs on the adjacency matrix $\\bm{A}$, modularity matrix $\\bm{B}$ and two similarity matrices $\\bm{S}$ and $\\bm{S}'$, respectively. The best representation is selected to input into the DSF for community feature mapping represented on each node $\\bm{h}_i$. Meanwhile, $\\bm{h}_i$ preserves the node similarity in the original network $\\bm{A}$ and latent community membership features. The node similarity is modeled in the loss function:\n\\begin{equation} \n\\small\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum\\nolimits_i \\| \\bm{h}_{i}\\|_1 + \\lambda \\sum\\nolimits_i KL(\\bm{h}_i, \\bm{h}^*_j),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$ is the $L_1$ norm penalty to optimize sparseness, $\\bm{h}^*_j$ denotes the representation of the most similar node to $v_{i}$ by measuring distances through KL divergence. When the learning process is optimized on the minimized loss, similar nodes are clustered into communities. The DSF architecture is investigated to be significant in experiments on real-world data sets. DSFCD discovers communities in higher accuracy than SF.\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering \\footnotesize\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{1.5mm}\n\\caption{Summary of

We now detail some typical applications in the following areas.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Recommendation Systems.} Community structure plays a vital role for graph-based recommendation systems , as the community members may have similar interests and preferences. By detecting relations between nodes (\\textit{i.e.}, users--users, items--tems, users--items), models such as CayleyNets  and UWMNE/WMCNE-LE  produce high-quality recommendations.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Biochemistry.} In this field, nodes represent proteins or atoms in compound and molecule graphs, while edges denote their interactions. Community detection can identify complexes of new proteins  and chemical compounds which are functional in regional organs (\\textit{e.g.}, in brain ) or pathogenic factor of a disease (\\textit{e.g.}, community-based lung cancer detection ). To various tumor types on genomic data sets, the previous study  shows relevances between communities' survival rates and distributions of tumor types over communities.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Online Social Networks.} \nAnalyzing online social activities can identify online communities and correlate them in the real world. The practice on online social networks  such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook reveals similar interests among online users that individual preferences can be automatically provided. Meanwhile, community detection can be used for online privacy  and to identify \\textbf{criminals} based on online social behaviors , who support and diffuse criminal ideas and even who may practice terrorism activities .\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Community Deception.} To hide from the community detection, community deception  covers a group of users in social networks such as Facebook. Deception is either harmful to virtual communities or harmless that provides justifiable benefits. From community-based structural entropy, Residual Entropy Minimization (REM) effectively nullify community detection algorithms . A systematic evaluation  on community detection robustness to deception is carried out in large networks.\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Community Search.} Community search aims to queue up a series of nodes dependent on communities . For example, a user (node) search on interests (communities) after another user (node). To this end, communities are formed temporally based on the user's interest. There are several practices applied in this scenario. Local community search  assumes one query node at a time and expands the search space around it. The strategy is attempted repeatedly until the community finds all its members. Attributed Truss Communities (ATC)  interconnects communities on query nodes with similar query node attributes.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{figure/application}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize Practical applications of community detection.}\n\\label{fig-application}\n\\end{figure}", "cites": [8483, 220, 6544, 6543], "cite_extract_rate": 0.21052631578947367, "origin_cites_number": 19, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of community detection applications in various domains, referencing specific papers to support examples.

Future works are expected to cope with signed edges and further identify positive/negative information automatically on edges.", "cites": [6532], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 2, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic synthesis of the key idea from the cited paper regarding the need for specialized methods in signed networks. It identifies the distinct nature of signed networks and highlights the potential of deep learning for embedding both positive and negative ties. However, it lacks deeper critical analysis or nuanced evaluation of existing approaches and primarily focuses on forward-looking suggestions without extensive comparative or meta-level insights."}}

The nodes are described by binary word vectors. Topics are class labels. \n\\textit{DBLP}\\footnote{\\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-DBLP.html}} is a co-authorship network from computer science bibliography website. A ground truth community labels that the authors who published papers on one journal or conference. In complicated scenarios, the heterogeneous \\textit{DBLP} can be extracted with considering diverse information such as co-authorship, citation.\n\\textit{ACM}\\footnote{\\url{http://dl.acm.org/}} is a paper network with two views, one view describes whether two papers are written by the same author, the other view depicts if the subjects of two papers are the same. The nodes (\\textit{i.e.} papers) are described by the bag-of-words of the keywords. The heterogeneous \\textit{ACM} can be constructed as well.\n\\textbf{Online Social Networks.}\nIn most of online social network data sets, nodes represent users, edges depict relationship between them such as friendships or followings. In the \\textit{YouTube}\\footnote{\\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Youtube.html}} dataset, social network is formed by users having friendship, each user-created group for video sharing is a community. \\textit{LiveJournal}\\footnote{\\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-LiveJournal1.html}} is a friendship social network collected from a online blog community where users state friendship to each other and define groups that can be ground truth communities. \\textit{PolBlogs}\\footnote{\\url{http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/}\\label{newman}} is a social blog network of weblogs on US politics, where nodes are blogs and hyperlinks between them extract to edges. \nSome data sets also collect node attributes. In the \\textit{Facebook}\\footnote{\\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html}} and \\textit{Twitter}\\footnote{\\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Twitter.html}} data sets, for example, attributes are described by user profiles while nodes and edges represent users and their connections, respectively. The heterogeneous \\textit{Twitter} extracts different types information from users, tweets, and locations. \\textit{Flickr} provides an online platform for users to share photos, the network is formed by users following each other, attributes are image tags, and community labels represent different interest groups. \\textit{Blogcatalog} is another blogger community, where attributes are extracted from users' blogs, community labels denote various topics. \\textit{Gplus}\\footnote{\\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Gplus.html}} is the ego network constructed by users sharing their \\textit{circles} in Google+, in which links exist if users follow each other and their profiles are extracted as attributes. Furthermore, there are three signed online social networks, \\textit{Slashdot} is extracted from the technology news site Slashdot where users form the relationships of friends or foes which represented by positive or negative links. \\textit{Epinions} is a \\textit{who trust whom} network constructed from the Epinions site\\footnote{\\url{http://www.epinions.com/}}, where the positive and negative edges reflects that users trust or distrust each other. In the signed \\textit{Wiki} data set, the network describes election of Wikipedia admins among users, edges indicate that the users vote \\textit{for} (positive) or \\textit{against} (negative) to the other. Considering heterogeneous information, \\textit{Last.fm} as a music website\\footnote{\\url{https://www.last.fm/}} constructs the network of users, artists and artist tags by tracking user listening information from various sources. \\textit{Foursquare} is another heterogeneous social network, which is formed by various kinds of location-related services. \n\\textbf{Traditional Social Networks.}\nThe data sets of \\textit{Karate}, \\textit{Dolphin} and \\textit{Football} are the most widely-used social networks in community detection. \\textit{Karate}\\textsuperscript{\\ref{newman}} describes friendships between 34 members of Zachary’s karate club. In \\textit{Dolphin}\\textsuperscript{\\ref{newman}} social network, nodes and edges represent dolphins and tighter connection between two dolphins, respectively. In \\textit{Football}\\textsuperscript{\\ref{newman}} data set, nodes represent different football teams while edges indicate the matches between them. Another traditional social network data sets include: the \\textit{Friendship6} and \\textit{Friendship7} data sets that construct high school friendship networks, and \\textit{Email}\\footnote{\\url{https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core.html}} data set describing email communication of the EU research institution. Considering the evolution of networks, \\textit{Cellphone Calls}\\footnote{\\url{http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/VASTchallenge08/download/Download.htm}} consists of a set of cell phone call records over ten days, where nodes are cell phones and edges represent phone calls. \\textit{Rados}\\footnote{\\url{http://networkrepository.com/ia-radoslaw-email.php}} and \\textit{Enron Email}\\footnote{\\url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\\%7Eenron/}} are popular email data sets from employees' communication over a period of time, where senders or recipients are represented by nodes and edges exist if two individuals emailed. Another three dynamic netowrks are \\textit{High School}, \\textit{Hospital} \nand \\textit{Hypertext}\\footnote{\\url{http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets}}. \\textit{High School} forms the temporal friendship network of contacts between students in different classes of a high school within one week. \\textit{Hospital} constructs the time-varing network of contacts between patients, patients and health-care workers and among the workers in a hospital during a few days. \\textit{Hypertext} extracts a social network of conference attendees during the ACM Hypertext 2009 conference.\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering \\footnotesize\n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{1mm}\n\\caption{Summary of real-world benchmark data sets.}
