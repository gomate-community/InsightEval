These strong abilities have been widely verified as emerging abilities for large language models~. \nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn from analogy. Figure~\\ref{fig:icl} gives an example that describes how language models make decisions via ICL.\nFirst, ICL requires a few demonstration examples to form a prompt context. These examples are usually written in natural language templates. \nThen, ICL concatenates a query question and the piece of prompt context together to form the input,  which is then fed into the language model for prediction.\nDifferent from supervised learning, which requires a training stage that uses backward gradients to update model parameters, ICL does not perform parameter updates. The model is expected to learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and accordingly make the right prediction. \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{fig/icl.pdf}\n    \\caption{Illustration of in-context learning. ICL requires a prompt context containing a few demonstration examples written in natural language templates. Taking this prompt and a query as the input, large language models are responsible for making predictions.}\n    \\label{fig:icl}\n\\end{figure}\n\\input{fig/taxonomy.tex}\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive advantages. \nFirst, since the demonstration is written in natural language, it provides an interpretable interface to communicate with LLMs~.\nThis paradigm makes it much easier to incorporate human knowledge into LLMs by changing the demonstration and templates~. \nSecond, in-context learning is similar to the decision process of human beings by learning from analogy~. \nThird, compared to supervised training, ICL is a training-free learning framework. \nThis could not only greatly reduce the computational costs for adapting the model to new tasks, but also make language-model-as-a-service~ possible and can be easily applied to large-scale real-world tasks.\nDespite being promising, there are also interesting questions and intriguing properties that require further investigation in ICL. \nAlthough a range of vanilla GPT models show excellent ICL capability, several studies have found that this capability can be significantly improved through adaptation during pretraining~.\nMoreover, the performance of ICL is sensitive to specific settings, including the prompt template, the selection and order of demonstration examples, and other factors~. Additionally, optimizing the conciseness of demonstration examples and improving the computational efficiency of ICL are critical areas of ongoing research~. \nFurthermore, despite preliminary explanations~, the underlying working mechanism of ICL remains unclear and requires further investigation.\nWith the rapid growth of studies in ICL, our survey aims to sensitize the community toward the current progress.\nIn the following sections, we delve into an in-depth discussion of related studies, and we summarize the key findings in Appendix~\\ref{app:takeaway}. \nWe highlight the challenges and potential directions and hope our work provide a useful roadmap for beginners interested in this area and shed light on future research.\nThe strong performance of ICL relies on two stages: (1) the training stage that cultivates the ICL ability of LLMs, and (2) the inference stage where LLMs predict according to task-specific demonstrations.\nIn terms of the training stage, LLMs are directly trained on language modeling objectives, such as left-to-right generation. Although the models are not specifically optimized for in-context learning, they still exhibit the ICL ability.\nExisting studies on ICL basically take a well-trained LLM as the backbone, and thus this survey will not cover the details of pretraining language models. \nTowards the inference stage, as the input and output labels are all represented in interpretable natural language templates, there are multiple directions for improving ICL performance. \nWe organize the current progress in ICL following the taxonomy above (as shown in Figure~\\ref{taxo_of_icl}). \nWith a formal definition of ICL~(\\S\\ref{sec:formulation}), \nwe provide a detailed discussion of the ICL-augmented pretraining and warmup approaches~(\\S\\ref{sec:training}) and the demonstration designing strategies (\\S\\ref{sec:prompt_tuning}). \\S\\ref{sec:analysis} provides in-depth discussions of current explorations on unveiling the secrets behind the ICL. \nWe further provide useful evaluation and resources~(\\S\\ref{sec:evaluation}), potential applications~(\\S\\ref{sec:application}) and potential challenges~(\\S\\ref{sec:challege_future}) in Appendix", "cites": [1578, 2189, 8470, 679, 3368, 7697, 8556, 1552, 1554, 3369, 2445, 9115], "cite_extract_rate": 0.631578947368421, "origin_cites_number": 19, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.3}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic descriptive overview of in-context learning, citing several relevant papers to support its points.

For a specific input, it first utilized unsupervised methods (e.g., BM25) to recall similar examples as candidates and then used this data to build a supervised dense retriever. Following EPR,  adopted a unified demonstration retriever to select demonstrations across different tasks.
