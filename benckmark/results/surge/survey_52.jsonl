In a white-box attack, an adversary can have full access to the model right from the start of training, which leads to the availability of training data, testing data, network architecture, parameters, and finally, the learned weights of a model, etc. Also, the number of queries an adversary can make comes under resources. For example, in a one-shot adversarial attack, the attacker has only a single shot at fooling the model; in such cases crafting the adversarial example does not involve a fine-tuning step. \n    When it comes to black-box attacks, the resources with adversary are considerably less. For one, the adversary will have no access to the model in the training phase, nor the adversary knows weights and parameters used in the model. However, once the model is deployed, based on the type of attack, the probability of each predicted label will be provided to the adversary. A stricter case is where only the predicted label is known to the attacker without any confidence score. Varying degree of information like labeled dataset is provided to adversaries in specific threat models. Again, as said above, the number of queries an attacker can make while crafting an adversarial example is considered under resources. An attack is deemed to be superior if the amount of resources consumed is minimal. \n}\n\\begin{table}[]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|ccc|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Month} & \\textbf{Year} & \\textbf{Method} & \\textbf{Proposed Approach} \\\\ \\hline\nFeb & 2016 & Papernot et al.  & Local substitute model \\\\\nDec & 2016 & Narodytska et al.  & Gradient-free \\\\ \\hline\nJul & 2017 & Narodytska et al.  & Advanced Local Search \\\\\nNov & 2017 & Chen et al.  & ZOO \\\\ \\hline\nFeb & 2018 & Brendel et al.  & Boundary Attack \\\\\nJul & 2018 & Ilyas et al.  & Limited Queries and Info \\\\\nJul & 2018 & Cheng et al.  & Opt-Attack \\\\\nOct & 2018 & Bhagoji et al.  & Query Reduction using Finite Differences \\\\\nOct & 2018 & Du et al.  & Attack using Gray Images \\\\ \\hline\nJan & 2019 & Tu et al.  & AutoZOOM \\\\\nApr & 2019 & Shi et al.  & Curls \\& Whey \\\\\nApr & 2019 & Dong et al.  & Translation-Invariant \\\\\nMay & 2019 & Chen et al.  & POBA-GA \\\\\nMay & 2019 & Brunner et al.  & Biased Sampling \\\\\nMay & 2019 & Li et al.  & NATTACK \\\\\nMay & 2019 & Moon et al.  & Combinatorial Optimization \\\\\nMay & 2019 & Ilyas et al.  & Bandits \\&Priors \\\\\nJul & 2019 & Alzantot et al.  & GenAttacks \\\\\nAug & 2019 & Guo et al.  & SimBA \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{A comparison of works that have focused on black-box scenarios in an adversarial setting.}\n\\label{chronological_table}\n\\end{table}", "cites": [909, 8103, 8101, 6144, 6141, 963, 6140, 907, 6143, 6139, 898, 913, 6142, 8102], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7368421052631579, "origin_cites_number": 19, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 1.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a basic description of black-box and white-box attack models and lists several methods chronologically with minimal contextual integration.

The threat model assumed by the authors is that the target model can only be queried to obtain the probability scores of all the classes. The loss function formulated is:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        For Targeted Attack: f(x,t) = max\\{max_{i\\neq t}log[F(x)]_i-log[F(x)]_t,-\\textit{k}\\}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \\begin{equation}\n        For Untargeted Attack: f(x) = \\{log[F(x)]_{t_0}- max_{i\\neq t_0}log[F(x)]_i,-\\textit{k}\\}\n    \\end{equation}\n    The author then uses \\textit{symmetric difference quotient} method to estimate the gradient $ \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x_i}$:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\hat{g} :=  \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x_i} \\approx \\frac{f(x+he_i)-f(x-he_i)}{2h}\n    \\end{equation}\n    The above naive solution requires querying the model $2p$ times, where $p$ is the dimension of the input.\n    So the author proposes two \\textit{stochastic coordinate methods}: ZOO-Adam and ZOO-Newton in which a gradient is estimated for a random coordinate and the update formula is obtained using ADAM  and Newton's Method until it reaches convergence. The authors also discuss the generation of noise in a lower dimension to improve efficiency and specify its advantages and disadvantages.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Limited Queries \\& Information}: The authors in  take three primary cases into account to devise successful black-box adversarial attacks. The first case talks about the constraint of limited queries that can be made to the model by the adversary. This could again be of two types- one that contains a time limit and the other that is concerned with the monetary limit. The authors present a variant of Natural Evolution Strategies(NES) coupled with Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), as used in white-box attacks, to construct adversarial examples.\n    The second case is modeled around the constraint of a partial-information setting where the adversary can obtain confidence scores of the first $k$ classes for a given input. These scores may not add up to 1 since the adversary doesn't have access to the probabilities for each possible classification label. To tackle this scenario, instead of beginning with the input image $x$, it is recommended to begin with $x_o$ belonging to the target adversarial class $y_{adv}$. Hence, after each step, we need to ensure two things-\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item The target adversarial class needs to remain in the top-k classes at all points in time when the input image is being perturbed.\n        \\begin{equation}\n            \\epsilon_t = min\\, \\epsilon'\\, s.t.\\, rank\\, \\big( y_{adv}|\\prod_{\\epsilon'}(x^{(t-1)})\\big) < k \n        \\end{equation}\n        \\item The probability of the input image getting classified as the target class increases with every iteration of PGD.\n        \\begin{equation}\n            x^{(t)} = arg\\, \\smash{\\displaystyle\\max_{x'}}\\, P\\big(y_{adv}|\\prod_{\\epsilon_{t-1}}(x')\\big) \n        \\end{equation}\n    \\end{itemize}\n    Lastly, in the third scenario, the adversary is not given any confidence scores. Instead, the adversary can only obtain the names of the classification labels for the given input data. The authors define a discretized score $R(x^{t})$ for an adversarial example to quantitatively represent the adversarial nature of the input image at each step $t$, with access only to the $top-k$ sorted labels. \n    The proposed approach was evaluated on the InceptionV3 network with 78\\% $top-1$ accuracy and also on Google Cloud Vision (GCV) API, which presents a real-world scenario to perform an adversarial attack. 90\\% and above accuracy is achieved for all three settings when the InceptionV3 network is attacked in the techniques mentioned above.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Opt-Attack}: Cheng et al.  attempt to devise a black box adversarial attack in a much stricter hard-label setting. This means that querying the target model gives only the target label, unlike other threat models where $K$-class probability scores or labels are considered.\n    The authors make the attack query-efficient by treating the problem as a real-valued, continuous optimization problem. \n    \\begin{comment}\n    They also explain the difficulty in formulating attacks in a hard-label black-box setting by using Figure \\ref{fig:query_eff}.\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\captionsetup{width= 0.7\\linewidth}\n        \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width = 0.8\\linewidth]{Images/Query_Efficient_HL.png}}\n        \\caption{(a) Decision Boundary of a Classifier where $f:R^d->\\{1,2...,K\\}$ and $x$ is the input image.

Chen et. al. uses ${\\theta}^* = argmin_{\\theta} \\hspace{0.1cm}g(\\theta)$ to obtain $x^* = x_0 + g({\\theta}^*)*\\frac{\\theta}{||\\theta||}$ by using a coarse grained search to initially find a decision boundary and then fine tuning the solution using Binary Search.\n    The optimization problem proposed above is solved using \\textit{Randomized Gradient Free (RGF) Method}, which is an iterative Zeroth Order Optimization(ZOO) Method in which the small increment value $\\textbf{\\textit{u}}_t$ is sampled randomly from a Gaussian Distribution.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Query Reduction using Finite Differences}: Finite Differences method was used to estimate the gradient in the case of black-box attacks where no knowledge regarding the gradient of the loss function exists. The authors in  propose a two-sided gradient estimation for a function $f(x)$, where $x \\in R^d$.\n    The loss function used in this scenario is based on logit, which was proved to work well in the white-box attacks . The logit loss is given by:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        l(x,y) = \\phi(x + \\delta)_{y}\\, -\\, max\\,\\{\\phi(x+\\delta)_i\\, : i \\neq y\\}\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $y$ represents the actual label for a given sample $x$ and $\\phi(.)$ are the logits.\n    By taking the logarithm of the SoftMax probabilities, the logit values can be computed up to an additive constant. This additive constant gets canceled out because the difference in the logits is equal to the loss function. Hence, the proposed method of using Finite Differences can be used to calculate the difference between the logit values of the actual label $y$ and the next most likely label $y'$.\n    A drawback to this naïve approach is that the model is required to make $O(d)$ queries per input, where $d$ is the dimensions of input. Authors have further proposed two query reduction techniques based on grouping the features. The first approach is based on a random selection of features and grouping them, which will allow for simultaneous gradient estimation for the selected features. The second approach is more technical since it involves computing directional derivatives along with the principal components as determined by principal component analysis (PCA).\n    The proposed approach was evaluated on two data sets - MNIST and CIFAR-10. Two models, one with two convolutional layers attached to a fully connected layer and another with three convolutional layers. These models were trained on the MNIST dataset. On the other hand, ResNet-32 and ResNet-28-10 models were used for training in the case of the CIFAR-10 data set. \n    The conclusion obtained from this approach is that the effectiveness of the crafted adversarial examples can be reduced by modifying the model output probabilities on which Gradient Estimation attacks are hugely dependent on.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Attack using Gray Images}: A completely new approach was followed in  to generate black-box adversarial examples by initializing the adversarial sample from a gray image. This is followed by the fact that the adversary doesn't have access to any natural input. This methodology begins by initializing the input for the target model with normalized pixel values within [0,1]. Hence, the adversary now has more flexibility in adding perturbation to the image by either increasing the pixel value to 1 to make it brighter or decreasing the pixel value to 0 to make it darker.\n    Then the authors have defined the fitness function in this approach as:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        J(\\theta) = P(y'|\\theta)\\approx[F(\\theta)]_{y'}\n    \\end{equation}\n    The objective here is to maximize the probability term given in the fitness function until the input image gets classified into another class y'. Similar to many other approaches, the authors have preferred to adopt NES optimization. Here $\\theta$ represents the perturbed input, and Gaussian search distribution has been chosen given the fact that it provides a more straightforward method of estimating the gradient where the two parameters that need to be optimized are mean $\\phi_{d}$ and variance $\\sigma_{dxd}$.\n    An important point to be noted in this approach is that this is a region-based attack algorithm, which implies that the gradients are dependent on the region space. Evaluation of gradients is then followed by performing a projected gradient ascent similar to the approach in . Input update can be shown as:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        x^t = \\prod_{[0,1]}(x^{t-1}+\\lambda sign(g_t(h,w)))\n    \\end{equation}\n    Where gamma represents the learning rate, and $\\pi_{[0,1]}$ represents the projection operator, which clips the values of the pixel in the range [0,1]. The search gradients are used to update the image iteratively until the goal is achieved.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{AutoZOOM}: Tu et al.  proposed the framework AutoZOOM, which is short for Autoencoder based Zeroth Order Optimization, for crafting efficient Black Box Attacks. The two main contributions of this approach were:\n    (i) an adaptive random gradient estimation method for stabilizing query counts and distortion and (ii)\n    an autoencoder trained offline on unlabelled data or a simple Bilinear Image Resizer(BiLIN) to \n    expedite the attack process. \n    The optimization problem formulated by Tu et al. :\n    \\begin{equation}\n        min_{x \\in {[0,1]}^d} Dist(x,x_0) + \\lambda. Loss(x,M(F(x)),t)\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $Dist(x,x_0)={||x-x_0||}_p$ , $F(x):{[0,1]}^d \\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}^K$, $M(.)$ is the monotonic function applied on classifier outputs, $Loss(.)$ is the attack objective reflecting the likelihood of predicting $t = argmax_{k \\in \\{1,2,...K\\}} [M(F(x))]_k$ and $\\lambda$ is the regularization constant.\n    Loss function can be both either training loss of DNN or C\\&W Loss .\n    Inspired by the convergence of \\textit{Symmetric Difference Quotient Method}  and taking query efficiency into consideration, the authors proposed a scaled random full gradient estimator of $\\nabla f(x)$, defined as:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\textbf{g} = b. \\frac{f(x+\\beta u)-f(x)}{\\beta}. u\n    \\end{equation}\n    To control error in gradient estimation, an average is taken over q random directions:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\bar{\\textbf{g}} = \\frac{1}{q} \\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\textbf{g}_j\n    \\end{equation}\n    They have also proven that $l_2$ distance between $\\bar{g}$ and $\\nabla f(x)$ is constrained by an upper bound:\n    \\begin{equation}\n     \\begin{split}\n         \\mathcal{E}||\\bar{g}-\\nabla f(x)||_2^2 \\leq & 4(\\frac{b^2}{d^2}+\\frac{b^2}{dq}+\\frac{(b-d)^2}{d^2})||\\nabla f(x)||_2^2 + \\frac{2q+1}{q}b^2 \\beta^2 L^2\n     \\end{split}   \n    \\end{equation}\n    The above upper bound is minimum when $b \\approx q$. They also mention that the convergence rate of zero order gradient descent methods is $O(\\sqrt{\\frac{d}{T}})$  and so it is plausible to generate perturbation from a lower dimension. In AutoZOOM, random gradient estimation is performed from a lower dimension $d^{\\prime}<d$ in order to improve query efficiency. A decoder,$D:\\mathcal{R}^{d^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}^d$ is used to add noise such that: $x = x_0 + D(\\delta^{\\prime})$ where $\\delta^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{d^{\\prime}}$. Initially $q=1$ but with each iteration q is increased in order to get more accurate estimation.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Bandits \\& Priors}: Ilyas et al.  successfully exploited prior information about the gradient using bandit optimization. Two key observations can meet the challenge of obtaining prior information about the gradient:-\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item The input data point for which gradient computation is carried out is not arbitrary, and its structure is predictable and also reflected in the gradient.\n        \\item Heavy correlation can be found among the gradients that are used in successive iterations while performing iterative gradient attacks (e.g., PGD).\n    \\end{itemize}\n    Two categories of priors, namely- time-dependent priors and data-dependent priors, have been introduced, which significantly helped in performing improved black-box adversarial attacks. The value of cosine similarity at each optimization step between successive gradients proves the correlation between them. Hence, the authors used the gradient at time $t-1$ as a prior for the gradient calculation at time $t$.\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\frac{\\big \\langle \\bigtriangledown_{x}L(x_t,y), \\bigtriangledown_x L(x_{t+1},y) \\big \\rangle}{\\norm{\\bigtriangledown_x L(x_t, y)}_2 \\norm{\\bigtriangledown_x L(x_{t+1},y)}_2}\\quad\n        t \\in \\{1...T-1\\}\n    \\end{equation}\n    On the other hand, an analogy to the correlation between pixel values of an image has been made to understand the relationship between gradients for two close coordinates. Hence, the structure of the input data point can also be used to reduce the query complexity.\n    Untargeted adversarial examples have been crafted by considering both $l_2$ and $l_{\\infty}$ norm-based threat models on the ImageNet data set. The approach experimented on three classifiers-Inception-v3, ResNet-50 and VGG16. An average of 1117 queries was required in the case of the proposed approach that made use of bandit optimization along with time and data-dependent priors as compared to about 1735 queries in the simple case of NES. Attack failure rate was decreased from 22.2\\% in $l_2$ and 34\\% in $l_{\\infty}$ for NES to 4.6\\% in $l_2$ and 15.5\\% in $L_\\infty$ for the Bandit approach.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [909, 890, 6143, 917, 6142, 913, 6145, 8102], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5714285714285714, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key concepts from multiple papers (e.g., ZOO, Opt-Attack, Finite Differences) to explain how gradient estimation is used in black-box attacks.

Labels for this synthetically crafted input data were obtained by querying the oracle $O$ itself. This assists the attacker to create an approximation $F$ of the target model $O$. The concept of transferability allows the attacker to ensure that $O$ will also misclassify the input images misclassified by the approximated model $F$. The primary challenge faced by the attacker in this approach is to train the model $F$ without any prior knowledge of the architecture $O$. Constraint on the number of times the attacker can query the model $O$ was a limitation as well. To overcome this problem, the authors propose Jacobian-based Dataset Augmentation, which helps in approximating the decision boundaries with limited queries.\n    Authors proposed a five-step approach, as listed below:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item The attacker collects a small set $S_o$, which represents the entire set of inputs $S$ to the oracle.

Their approach consists of two steps. The first step proposed deals with the problem of adding noises/perturbation to an input sample monotonically along the gradient ascent's direction using Curl's iteration. In contrast, the second step deals with the issue of removing excessive redundant noises from the crafted adversarial examples using Whey optimization. The proposed methodology can be better understood through .\n    The methodology aims to push the input data point $x$ from the current class to a different class with which it shares its decision boundary. To perform the same operation, noise may be added to this data point monotonically along the direction of gradient ascent. However, the authors propose a shortcut to reach a nearer point that is present across the decision boundary. They suggest to initially follow the direction of the gradient descent and reach the 'valley floor' and then perform iterations to climb up the gradient. This is known as the Curl's iteration.

The calculation of the gradient makes use of the assumption that convolutional neural networks possess the translation-invariant property.

Their proposed algorithm perturbs an image by choosing the most relevant pixels of the image to which noise is added. The observed change by adding this noise in each iteration is used to approximate the loss function's gradient. The importance of the pixels can be understood in this step by observing the change in classification accuracy after each round.\n    The most important contribution of this work is the creation of the neighboring images to a given input image. This neighborhood will consist of all images that are different from the previous round's image by one pixel only. Initially, a pixel location is randomly selected, and perturbation is added to it. The next pixel location is chosen among all the pixels that lie within a square whose side length is $2p$, and the center is the previous pixel location, where $p$ is an arbitrary parameter.\n    The authors have focused on $k-misclassification$, where the correct label for an image should not be enlisted in the top-k classes predicted by the model. As soon as the target model can push the right class out of the top-k classes, no more noise is added to the image, and the algorithm gets terminated. The local search technique adopted is modified to increase the classification score of the targeted class in each round, in the case of targeted attacks.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Advanced Local Search}: Local search technique is a commonly used incomplete search algorithm used to solve problems on combinatorics. In , the authors have used this strategy over the image space to construct an approximated network gradient. The objective function is to minimize the probability that the perturbed image does not share the classification label with the original image. The cost function defined is-\n    \\begin{equation}\n        f_{c(I)}(\\hat{I})=o_{c(I)}\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $NN(\\hat{I})=(o_1,...,o_C)$, in which NN is the target neural network model and $o_j$ represents the probability of image $\\hat{I}$ belonging to class $j$. This function is minimized by the local search technique.\n    The next step in the formulation is to create a set of images that can act as neighbors of the original image. The authors have defined these neighbor images with the help of pixel locations since images generated after a single iteration differ only in one pixel from the previous image. Consider the pixels that were perturbed in the last round. Hence, in the current round, all those pixels that lie in a square of side length $2d$ with the perturbed pixel at its center will be considered. Here, $d$ is only a parameter.\n    In the last step, a function $g$ has been defined as the transformation function, which generates a new image $\\hat{I}_i$ after every round $i$ by adding perturbation to a set of pixels only.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Boundary Attack}: Decision-based  adversarial attacks that are based on a model's final decision, i.e., class labels or transcribed sentences, are more common in real-life scenarios as compared to confidence score-based attacks. The authors also argue that these attacks are more robust to defense techniques such as gradient masking, intrinsic stochasticity, or vigorous training. Also, lesser information regarding the targeted model is required to conduct a successful attack. This was the first time that decision-based attacks were introduced that focus on deep learning models using real-life data sets such as ImageNet.\n    The proposed algorithm initializes by taking a random distribution of pixels for an image in the range of [0, 255]. Using this image, the algorithm traverses the decision boundary of the class to which the sample input image belongs to. The initialized image is then able to reduce its distance w.r.t. the input image besides staying inside the adversarial region. \n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{POBA-GA}: Chen et al.  proposed three parameters to be used to generate different perturbations- different noise point pixel thresholds, number of noise points, and noise point size. The next step is to add this noise to the first adversarial example to generate the next generation of the population. For evaluation purposes, a fitness function $\\phi$ is defined, followed by checking if the adversary has satisfied the termination condition or not. Lastly, to generate the next set of the population for optimizing the perturbation, the suggested approach follows the typical operations of a genetic algorithm, i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation.\n    The importance of the proposed fitness function is that it helps to evaluate how useful the adversarial input is at a given iteration. Hence, the convergence of the model largely depends on this function. The authors have incorporated two critical qualities of adversarial images into the definition of the proposed function which are\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\phi(AS^t_i) = P(AS^t_i) - \\frac{\\alpha}{max Z(A^0)}Z(A^t_i)\n    \\end{equation}\n    where the left-hand side of the equation represents the fitness function for Adversarial Sample $i$, $(AS_i)$ is the probability term which accounts for the effectiveness of the attack for the sample to get misclassified and $Z(A^t_i)$ is a metric originally proposed in this methodology to account for the perturbation introduced. $\\alpha$ is used as a parameter to control the proportion for the fitness function between attack performance and the perturbation size. To reduce the number of queries to the target model, alpha is initially taken as zero and later assigned a value when the attack is successful. The fitness function finally looks like-\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\phi (AS^t_i) = \n        \\begin{cases}\n            {p(y_1|AS^t_i) - p(y_0|AS^t_i) - \\frac{\\alpha}{max Z(A^{t_0})}Z(A^t_i)} \\quad \\quad {y_1 \\neq y_0}\\\\\n            {p(y_2|AS^t_i) - p(y_0|AS^t_i)}\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\, \\, {y_1 = y_0}\n        \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{Biased Sampling}: The authors in  adopt a unique approach to introduce perturbations for creating adversarial samples known as Perlin Noise . This method was originally used to generate procedural texture patterns for computer graphics but can also be used to develop parametrized patterns having low-frequency. In the case of an original Boundary Attack , an orthogonal perturbation $\\eta^k$ is applied along with a hyper-spherical surface present around the original image. However,  Perlin noise distribution is used to create a sample to introduce a low-frequency before the Boundary Attack. Usually, a permutation vector $v$ with a size of 256 is used to parametrize the noise. The noise patterns are sampled in two directions- along with the height and width of the image due to which the patters get strongly concentrated in the directions of low-frequency.\n    Image masking has been performed to calculate the difference between the pixel values of the original image and the adversarial image and can be shown as:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        M = \\abs {X_{adv} - X_{orig}}\n    \\end{equation}\n    This calculation is performed after every step and applied on every single element of the orthogonal perturbation $\\eta^k$ that was sampled previously.\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\eta^k_{biased} = M \\odot \\eta^k\\, ;\\, \\eta^k_{biased} = \\frac{\\eta^k_{biased}}{\\norm{\\eta^k_{biased}}}\n    \\end{equation}\n    Hence, the distortion of only the pixels with a considerable difference value is increased, and it remains the same for the remaining pixels, further reducing the search space effectively.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{$\\mathcal{N}$-Attack}: A black box adversarial attack has been proposed in , which tries to learn the probability density over a small region $(l_p \\hspace{0.1cm}ball)$ centered around the input such that a sample drawn from the density is likely an adversarial image. Their work is similar to Ilyas et al.  who have employed the loss function: $f(x^{\\prime}) := -F(x^{\\prime})_y $. They have argued that Ilyas et al.'s  algorithm is inferior as it relies on accurate estimation of gradients, which is not possible when DNN is non-smooth. For estimating gradients $\\nabla f(x_t)$ with derivative-free methods the authors have also used \\textit{NES} .\n    The smooth optimization criteria proposed by the authors is:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    min_{\\theta}J(\\theta):= \\int f(x^{\\prime}) \\pi_S(x^{\\prime}|\\theta) dx^{\\prime}\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $f(x^{\\prime})$ is the C\\&W Loss , $\\pi_S(x^{\\prime}|\\theta)$ is the probability density in region S $(l_p \\hspace{0.1cm} ball)$ i.e $||x^{\\prime}-x||_p \\leq \\epsilon$ and also $dim(\\theta) << dim(x)$. The authors reformulated the problem with change of variables:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        x^{\\prime} = proj_S(g(z)),\\hspace{0.3cm} z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(z|\\mu,\\sigma^2)\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $g:\\mathbb{R}^{dim(\\mu)} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{dim(x)}$. The transformation steps involve sampling z\n    i.e $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$, then $g(z)$ is computed: $g(z)= \\frac{1}{2(tanh(g_0(z))+1)}$. After\n    this, $\\delta^{\\prime}=clip_p(g(z)-x)$ for p = 2 or $\\infty$:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        clip_2(\\delta) = \n        \\begin{cases}\n            \\delta\\tau_2 / ||\\delta||_2 & if ||\\delta||_2 > \\tau_2 \\\\\n            \\delta & else\n        \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \\begin{equation}\n        clip_{\\infty} = min(\\delta, \\tau_\\infty)\n    \\end{equation}\n    Updated $J(\\theta)$ due to variable transformation:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        J(\\theta)= \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{N}(z|\\mu,\\sigma^2)}f(proj(g(z)))\n    \\end{equation*}\n    $\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ are the unknowns. $\\sigma$ is found using Grid Search and \\textit{NES} \n    is used to find $\\mu$:\n     \\begin{equation*}\n     \\mu_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mu_t - \\eta \\nabla_{\\mu}J(\\theta)|_{\\mu_t}\n     \\end{equation*}\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\mu_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mu_t -\\frac{\\eta}{b} \\sum_{i=1}^{b}f(proj_S(g(z_i)))\\nabla_{\\mu}log \\mathcal{N}\n      (z_i|\\mu_t,\\sigma^2)\n    \\end{equation}\n    The process is iteratively repeated until arriving at an sampled image $x^{\\prime}$ such that $C(x^{\\prime}) \\neq C(x)$.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{GenAttack}: Alzantot et al.  use genetic algorithms, which are population-based gradient-free optimization strategies to produce an adversarial image. The author justifies using the above approach by mentioning the overhead produced by excessive querying in \\textit{Gradient Estimation Methods} and also the added advantage of being able to bypass defenses based on Gradient Masking and Obfuscation. The Genetic Algorithm is based on the process of natural selection, which involves iteratively choosing the \\textit{\\textbf{P}} set of candidates that constitute a \\textit{generation} in each iteration. The quality of the candidates is assessed using a \\textit{fitness} function, and the candidates for the next generation are obtained using \\textit{crossover}, i.e., breeding of parents selected randomly to produce a child and \\textit{mutation} which is the noise added to the child to reflect the diversity of the population. The fitness function proposed here can be shown as:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        Fitness(x) = log{f(x)}_t - log{\\sum_{j=0,j\\neq t}^{j=k}f(x)_c}\n    \\end{equation}\n    Here $f: \\mathbb{R}^d->[0,1]^K $ is the black box classifier which outputs probabilities of the $K$ classes and $t$ is the label for targeted attack. The parents for crossover are randomly sampled using $probs$, i.e. the probabilities which are obtained using softmax of the fitness values. Crossover operation involves selecting features of $parent_1$ and $parent_2$ with $(p,1-p)$ respectively where $p = \\frac{fitness(parent_1)}{fitness(parent_1)+ fitness(parent_2)}$. A Child is mutated using the following formula $child_{mut} = child+ \\mathit{Bernoulli}(p)* \\mathfrak{\\textbf{U}}(-\\alpha \\delta_{max},\\alpha\\delta_{max})$. $\\alpha,\\rho$ and $\\delta_{max}$ are mutation range, mutation probability and $l_{\\infty}$ metric respectively.\n    \\vspace{5mm}\n    \\item \\textbf{SimBA}: The study shown in  proposes a straightforward yet efficient approach to generate adversarial examples in a black-box setting. From a set $Q$ of orthonormal vectors, the algorithm picks any single vector $q$, and the modification made to the input image $x$ can be expressed as $x + q\\epsilon$ or $x - q\\epsilon$. The idea behind this is to modify and add noise to the image in a particular direction and check if this brings about a change in the probability $P(y|x)$, which represents the probability of the label being $y$ given the input image $x$. Here, $\\epsilon$ represents the step size and can be controlled by the adversary. To keep the number of queries to the target model minimum, the methodology proposed ensures that when the algorithm picks $q \\in Q$, there are no two directions that cancel out each other.\n    Inspired by the work of Guo , the authors suggest making use of low-frequency noise to be added to the input image for generating better adversarial examples. They employ the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to map signals in a 2D image space $R^{dxd}$ to frequency coefficients belongs to cosine wave function magnitudes.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [909, 6147, 6140, 8103, 8982, 6139, 898, 890, 907, 6141], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7692307692307693, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section primarily describes specific attack techniques from cited papers, focusing on their methodology and equations, but lacks integration or synthesis across the works.

The authors support this my mentioning that first-order attacks like FGSM  and PGD  have a good performance due to their constrained nature and also due to querying the gradient of the loss concerning the input.\n    Using the Taylor Expansion, the loss and the optimization problem becomes:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        l(x_{adv},y) \\approx l(x,y) + (x_{adv}-x)^T \\nabla_x l(x,y)\n    \\end{equation*}\n    \\begin{equation}\\label{parsi_eq}\n         maximize_{||x_{adv}-x||_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon} \\Rightarrow maximize_{x_{adv}} {x_{adv}}^T \\nabla_x\n        l(x,y) \\hspace{0.3cm} subject \\hspace{0.1cm} to \\hspace{0.1cm} - \\epsilon \\textbf{1} \\preceq x_{adv}-x \\preceq \\epsilon \\textbf{1} \n    \\end{equation}\n    Due to the bounds present in the equation \\ref{parsi_eq}, the authors concluded that the solution of the above linear program would be obtained at the vertex of the $l_{\\infty}$ ball.

The results for different comparative parameters are obtained from standard performance metrics as produced by the individual research studies.\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{adjustbox}{width = \\textwidth, center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Method} & \\textbf{Model} & \\textbf{Average \\# Queries} & \\textbf{Average $L_2$} & \\textbf{Attack Success Rate} & \\textbf{Specific Parameters Used} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Chen et al.      & InceptionV3 & -     & 1.19916 & 88.90\\% & Step Size = 0.002, \\# Iterations = 1500 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Brendel et al.      & ResNet-50 & 192102 & 4.876 & 100\\% & - \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Cheng et al.      & ResNet-50 & 145176 & 4.934 & 100\\% & - \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Moon et al.     & InceptionV3 & 722   & -     & 98.50\\% & $L_{\\infty}$ setting, $\\epsilon$ = 0.05, Max \\# Queries = 10,000 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Guo et al.     & InceptionV3 & 1283  & 3.06  & 97.80\\% & Step Size = 0.2, \\# Iterations = 10,000 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{adjustbox}\n  \\caption{Comparison of methods used for generating an untargeted attack on the ImageNet data set.}\n  \\label{imagenet_untargeted}\n\\end{table}\nFrom Table \\ref{imagenet_untargeted}, we can see that the attack success rate for  and  is 100\\%.

A second training set $\\left\\{ (X,F(X)):X \\in \\mathcal{X}\\right\\}$ is obtained and $F(X)$ obtained from the first DNN are here used as the \\textit{soft labels}.

The random resizing layer converts an image of size $W{*}H{*}3$ into a new image of size $W{'}{*}H{'}{*}3$ such that $|W{'}-W|$ and $|H{'}-H|$ are within a reasonably small range. The random padding layer pads zeros around the resized image in a random manner. Suppose after random padding the size of the image is $W{''}{*}H{''}{*}3$ then there are $(W{''}-W{'}+1){*}(H{''}-H{'}+1)$ different possible patterns.\\\\\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.5\\linewidth]{New_Images/adv_effects_mitigation.png}\n        \\caption{Pipeline of the randomization based defense mechanism.}\n        \\label{fig:adv_eff_random}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n     \\item \\textbf{SAP}: The authors  have proposed \\textit{Stochastic Activation Pruning} as a method for guarding pre-trained networks against adversarial examples. During the forward pass, they stochastically prune a subset of activations in each layer. After pruning, they scale up the surviving activations to normalize the dynamic range of inputs to the subsequent layers. Deriving inspiration from game theory , they treat the problem as a minimax zero-sum game between adversary and the model:\n    \\begin{equation}\n      \\pi^{*},\\rho^{*} := arg \\hspace{0.1cm}min_{\\pi} max_{\\rho} \\mathbb{E}_{p \\sim \\pi,r \\sim \\rho}[J(M_p(\\theta),x+r,y)],   \n    \\end{equation}\n    where $\\rho$ is the adversary's policy from which $r \\sim \\rho$ perturbation is sampled and $\\pi$ is the defender's policy from which $p \\sim \\pi$ model parameters corresponding to $M_p(\\theta)$ is sampled. The adversary's goal is to maximize the defender's loss under strategy $\\rho$ and defender's goal is to minimize the loss by changing model parameters $\\theta$ to $M_p(\\theta)$ under strategy $\\pi$. Now given the $i$'th layer activation map,$h^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{a^i}$, the probability of sampling $j$'th activation with value $(h^i)_j$ is given by:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        p_{j}^{i} = \\frac{|(h^i)_j|}{\\sum_{k=1}^{a^i}|(h^i)_k|}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    If activation is sampled, it is scaled up by inverse of the probability of sampling over all draws. If not, then the activation is set to 0. In this way, the inverse propensity scoring of each activation is preserved. Under an instance $p$ of policy $\\pi$, $r_{p}^{i}$ sample are drawn giving a new activation map $M_p(h^i)$:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        M_p(h^i) = h^i \\odot m_{p}^{i} \\hspace{0.5cm} (m_{p}^{i})_j = \\frac{\\mathbb{I}((h^i)_j)}{1-(1-p_{j}^{i})^{r_{p}^{i}}}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    This scheme is similar to dropout ; however, it differs from it in its sampling technique: SAP is more likely to sample activations that are high in absolute value whereas dropout samples each activation with the same probability.\n    \\end{itemize}", "cites": [945, 681, 932], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides clear descriptions of each defense technique (distillation, randomization, and SAP) and their mechanisms, but it lacks synthesis across methods or deeper comparative analysis.

Specifically, \\textit{total variance minimization} and \\textit{image quilting} were effective defenses when the model is trained on transformed images. Their strength lies in their \\textit{non-differential nature} and \\textit{randomness} which makes it difficult for the adversary to circumvent them.\n    Total Variance Minimization involves synthesizing an image $\\mathbf{z}$ from adversarial input x by solving:\n    \\begin{equation}\n      min_{z}||(1-X) \\odot (z-x) ||_{2} + \\lambda_{TV}.TV_p(\\mathbf{z})  \n    \\end{equation}\n    This approach selects a small set of pixels and reconstructs the image $x$ that is consistent with the selected pixels.

Goodfellow et al.  provided evidence that several network architectures are vulnerable to adversarial examples as the loss function of these networks tend to be highly linear to its inputs. Though neural networks, in principle, can represent highly non-linear functions, networks trained via SGD tend to converge to linear solutions. One hypothesis explaining this states that the nonlinearities used in networks are piece-wise linear. Instead of using highly complex non-linear functions that are difficult to train and generalize, the authors have specified a simple non-differentiable and non-linear transformation(\\textit{discretization}). Two discretization methods have been specified: 1) \\textbf{One Hot Encoding}: for a pixel $\\mathit{i} \\in \\{1,2,...n \\}$:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        f_{oneshot}(x_i) = \\chi(b(x_i)) \n    \\end{equation}\n    where $b(\\theta)$ is the quantization function. For $b_i= \\frac{i}{k}$, $b(\\theta)$ is the largest index $\\alpha \\in \\{1,2,...k \\}$ such that $\\theta \\leq b_{\\alpha}$. $\\chi(j)$ is the one hot vector of $j$ i.e $\\chi(j) \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ such that:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\chi(j)_l =\n        \\begin{cases}\n                 & 1 \\hspace{0.3cm} if \\hspace{0.1cm} l=j \\\\\n        & 0 \\hspace{0.3cm} otherwise\n        \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    So for an input pixel $i$, $b(.)$ obtains the index $\\alpha$ such that $i \\leq b_{\\alpha}$. $\\chi(.)$ computes the one hot vector spread across the length of the input dimension and sets 1 at index $\\alpha$ and 0 everywhere else.\n    2) \\textbf{Thermometer Encoding}: For a pixel $i \\in \\{1,2,...k \\}$:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        f_{therm}(x_i) = \\tau(b(x_i)) = \\mathbb{C}(f_{oneshot}(x_i))\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $\\mathbb{C}$ is the cumulative sum function, $\\mathbb{C}(c)_l = \\sum_{j=0}^l c_l$. $\\tau(j)$ is the thermometer vector i.e $\\tau(j) \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ such that:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\tau(j)_l = \n        \\begin{cases}\n        & 1 \\hspace{0.3cm} if\\hspace{0.1cm} l>=j \\\\\n        & 0 \\hspace{0.3cm} otherwise\n        \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    $\\tau(j)$ computes the thermometer vector, which is one hot vector with consecutive one after the index $\\alpha$ obtained using the $b(.)$ function. \\newline\n     \\item \\textbf{Defense-GAN}: Samangouei et al.  proposed a defense mechanism based on \\textit{Wasserstein-GAN} . A GAN is a model in which min-max game is played between two adversaries:- \\textit{a generator(G)} and \\textit{a discriminator(D)}. The \\textit{W-GAN} is similar to \\textit{GAN}, but instead of min-max loss, Wasserstein loss is used for learning the distribution of unperturbed images. At inference time, it finds a close output to the given input image which does not contain adversarial changes i.e., for an input image $x$ we obtain $z^*$ such that:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        z^* \\hspace{0.1cm} = \\hspace{0.1cm} min_z ||G(z)-x||_{2}^{2}\n    \\end{equation}\n    The above minimization problem is solved by doing L steps of Gradient Descent on R different random initializations of z. Then $G(z^*)$ is added as the input to the classifier. The motivation of the above mechanism is derived from the global optimality of \\textit{GAN} min-max loss when $p_g=p_{data}$ i.e., the probability that the image is sampled from data distribution is equal to that of the generator and if \\textit{G} and \\textit{D} have enough capacity to represent the data, and the training algorithm is such that $p_g$ converges to $p_{data}$ then:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{data}} \\left[ min_z ||G_t(z)-x||_2\\right] \\rightarrow 0 \n    \\end{equation}\n    where $\\mathbb{E}$ is the expected reconstruction loss which after $t$ steps of training converges to 0, thereby indicating minuscule performance loss on clean examples. This minimization of reconstruction loss helps in reducing the adversarial noise. \\newline\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.6\\linewidth]{New_Images/defensegan-model.png}\n        \\caption{Defense-GAN Mechanism }\n        \\label{fig:defgan_model}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.6\\linewidth]{New_Images/defensegan-grad-descent.png}\n        \\caption{L steps of Gradient Descent}\n        \\label{fig:defgan_gd}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    \\item \\textbf{Pixel Deflection}: The authors have proposed two methods for defending against adversarial attacks: 1) Pixel Deflection samples pixels randomly in an input image and replaces it with another randomly sampled pixel from its square neighborhood. Intuitively, Prakash et al.  show that adversarial attacks tend to add perturbations in the entire plane of the image, disregarding the location of the object. The background pixels are not that useful in the classification of the object. By \\textit{Pixel Deflection}, certain pixels are dropped, preserving enough background for classification and mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks. The probability for a pixel to be dropped is inversely proportional to the probability of that pixel constituting the part of an object i.e\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        Pr_{u}(P_i) \\propto \\frac{1}{Pr_{o}(P_i)}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    2) Wavelet Denoising is used to reduce noise introduced by both pixel deflection and adversarial attacks. Prior works  illustrate certain regularities in wavelet responses of natural images that can be used to denoise images. The author's method uses \\textit{Discrete Wavelet Transform} , which converts the image signal into orthonormal wavelets. These wavelets form the basis for an image's space, orientation, and scale, etc. \\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{Basis Function Transformations}: Shaham et al.  augments images at inference time using basis functions. The transformations smoothen the images thereby reducing adversarial noise. Basis functions are known functions (usually polynomial) on which linear regression is performed in order to model a non-linear function. The basis functions used in this paper include: 1) \\textit{Low Pass Filtering} 2) \\textit{Principal Component Analysis} 3) \\textit{Wavelet Approximation} 4) \\textit{Soft-thresholding} 5) \\textit{JPEG Compression} \\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{ Guided Denoiser}: Since adversarial samples are based on adding noise to clean images, the natural idea that came to the authors was to develop denoising models as a defense mechanism . They defined two denoising networks:\\\\ 1)\\textbf{Pixel Guided Denoiser(PGD)}: Given a clean image $x$, the denoiser $D:x{*} \\rightarrow \\hat{x}$ is used to convert the adversarial image $x{*}$ into $\\hat{x}$ such that $L = ||x-\\hat{x}||$ is minimized where L is the $L_1$ norm. Two denoising functions were discussed-1) \\textit{Denoising Autoencoder(DAE)}  and \\textit{Denoising U-Net(DUNET)} which was DAE modified with U-Net .\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.7\\linewidth]{New_Images/Denoiser_1.png}\n        \\caption{Denoising Autoencoder and Denoising U-Net}\n        \\label{fig:Denoiser_1}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    2)\\textbf{High-Level representation Guided Denoiser(HGD)}: HGD uses the same U-Net structure as DUNET but differs with it in terms of the loss function. Given a target neural network $f$, the HGD minimizes the loss $L=||f(x)_l-f(\\hat{x})_l||$ where $f(x)_l$ is the representation of the neural network at layer $l$. Three variants of HGD were also specified-1) When $l=-2$, then the representations of the top-most\n    convolutional layer is used, and the denoiser is called \\textit{Feature Guided Denoiser}. 2)When $l=-1$,\n    logit layer representations are used, and the denoiser is called \\textit{Logits Guided Denoiser}. 3)When the classification loss of the target model is used as a denoising loss function, then the denoiser is called \\textit{Class Guided Denoiser}. \\newline\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h!]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.7\\linewidth]{New_Images/Denoiser_2.png}\n        \\caption{Feature Guided Denoiser(FGD), Logits Guided Denoiser(LGD) and Class Guided Denoiser(CGD)}\n        \\label{fig:Denoiser_2}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    \\item \\textbf{PixelDefend}: The authors  have proposed the defense mechanism \\textit{PixelDefend} which aims to detect adversarial images and modify the input images such that it resembles more the images derived from the training distribution $p(x)$. The training distribution $p(x)$ is learnt through a PixelCNN (p(x)=$p_{CNN}(x)$). The probabilities of the input image, $X{'} \\sim q(X)$ and training images, $\\{X_1,X_2,...X_N \\} \\sim p(X)$ are evaluated using PixelCNN and rank of $p_{CNN}(X')$ in $\\{p_{CNN}(X_1),p_{CNN}(X_2),...p_{CNN}(X_N)\\} $ is used as a text-statistic:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n     T = T(X{'};X_1....X_N) \\triangleq \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{I}[p_{CNN}(X_i) \\leq p_{CNN}(X{'})].   \n    \\end{equation*}\n    The above equation is used to calculate the \\textit{p-value}, which is used as a metric to decide whether an image is adversarial or not:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        p = \\frac{1}{N+1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\mathbb{I}[T_i \\leq T] +1 \\right) = \\frac{T+1}{N+1} = \\frac{1}{N+1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{I}[p_{CNN}(X_i) \\leq p_{CNN}(X{'})]+1 \\right)\n    \\end{equation}\n    Now the input image $X$ is used to calculate the image $X^*$ that maximizes $p(X)$ subject to the constraint that $X^*$ is within the $\\epsilon_{defend}$ ball(maximum perturbation) of $X$:\n   \\begin{align*}\n       & max_{X^*}p(X^*) \\\\\n       s.t \\hspace{0.2cm} & ||X-X^*||_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon_{defend}\n   \\end{align*}\n    Iteratively pixels ($ x \\leftarrow X[i,j,k]$) are sampled from the range $R \\leftarrow [max(x-\\epsilon_{defend},0),min(x+ \\epsilon_{defend},255)]$, with the goal to maximize the training data distribution $p(X^*)$.\n    \\end{itemize}", "cites": [8396, 8104, 917, 930, 950, 934, 64, 941, 6150, 507, 952, 892], "cite_extract_rate": 0.65, "origin_cites_number": 20, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a factual description of input transformation techniques but lacks substantial synthesis of ideas across the cited works.

He proposed \\textit{Ensemble Adversarial Training} as a method for decoupling the adversarial examples from the parameters of the trained model and increase the diversity of perturbations seen during training. The algorithm augments the training dataset of the target model with adversarial examples transferred from \\textit{other static pre-trained} models. Intuitively, the transfer of adversarial examples from multiple models acts as a good approximation of maximization problem in Madry et al.'s  paper, which was not possible from transferable single step attacks. \\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{ALP}: In this paper , Kannan et al. proposed a method called as \\textit{logit pairing} and its 2 variants- \\textit{clean} and \\textit{adversarial}. They compared their method with a modified version of defense proposed by Madry et al.  which they formulated as \\textbf{mixed minibatch PGD}. \\textbf{M-PGD} is stated as min-max problem:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        argmin_{\\theta} \\left[ \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\in \\hat{p}_{data}} \\left( max_{\\delta \\in \\mathit{S}}L(\\theta,x+\\delta,y)\\right)+ \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\in \\hat{p}_{data}} \\left( L(\\theta,x,y) \\right) \\right]\n    \\end{equation}\n    \\textbf{Adversarial and Clean Logit Pairing} involve minimizing following losses respectively:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\label{adv_logit_pair}\n      J(\\mathbb{M},\\theta) + \\lambda \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} L\\left( f(x^{(i)};\\theta),f(\\bar{x}^{(i)};\\theta) \\right)  \n    \\end{equation}\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\label{clean_logit_pair}\n         J^{(clean)}(\\mathbb{M},\\theta) + \\lambda \\frac{2}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\frac{m}{2}} L\\left( f(x^{(i)};\\theta),f(x^{(i+\\frac{m}{2})};\\theta) \\right)\n    \\end{equation}\n    Here $J(\\mathbb{M},\\theta)$ is the classifier loss for minibatch $\\mathbb{M}$. $\\lambda$ and m are the penalizing coefficient and training size respectively. $f(x,\\theta)$ is the logit layer and \\textbf{L} is the loss function for calculating the similarity of two images.

He proposes a guarantee that a adversarial robust model should satisfy in the form of a \\textit{Saddle-Point} problem:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    min_{\\theta} \\rho(\\theta),\\hspace{0.4cm}\\text{where}\\hspace{0.2cm} \\rho(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim D}\\left[max_{\\delta \\in \\textit{S}}L(\\theta,x+\\delta,y) \\right] \n    \\end{equation}\n    Evaluation of local maxima of loss values by using \\textit{PGD}  attack on \\textit{MNIST} and \\textit{CIFAR-10} models suggest that PGD is the universal adversary among the first-order approaches. Robustness against PGD yields robustness against all first-order adversaries i.e., as long as the adversary uses the gradients of the loss function w.r.t input, it will not find significantly better local maxima than PGD. So to maximize the inner optimization problem, PGD is the best first-order attack, whereas adversarial training is the solution for the outer optimization problem. The authors also provide a comparative study of network capacity against adversarial robustness. For a weaker \\textit{black-box} attack based on transferability, increased network capacity decreases transferability. Adversarial training using stronger adversaries also reduces transferability. \\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{PNI}: Rakin et al.  has proposed \\textit{Parametric Noise Injection} which aims to make the model more robust by adding trainable gaussian noise at each layer on either activation or weights during the adversarial training phase:\n    \\begin{align}\n        &\\bar{v_i} = f_{PNI}(v_i) = v_i +\\alpha_i.\\eta; \\hspace{0.4cm} \\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2) \\\\\n        &where \\hspace{0.2cm} \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i(v_i-\\mu)}\n    \\end{align}\n    Here $v_i$ is the element of noise-free tensor $v$, which can be input/weight/activation. $\\eta$ is the noise sampled from the gaussian distribution, and $\\alpha_i$ is the learnable noise parameter, which is the same along with a layer to avoid over-parameterization and facilitate convergence. The gradient computation of loss w.r.t to noise is:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\alpha}=\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial f_{PNI}(v_i)} \\frac{\\partial f_{PNI}(v_i)}{\\partial \\alpha}; \\hspace{0.3cm} \\frac{\\partial f_{PNI}(v_i)}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\eta\n    \\end{equation*}\n    Using a gradient descent optimizer with momentum, the optimization of $\\alpha$ at step $j$ can be written as:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        V_{i}^{j} = m.V_{i}^{j-1} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}^{j-1}}{\\partial \\alpha}; \\hspace{0.3cm} \\alpha^j = \\alpha^{j-1} - \\epsilon.V_{i}^j\n    \\end{equation*} \n    where m is the momentum, $\\epsilon$ is the learning rate, and $V$ is the updating velocity.\\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{Feature Denoising}: Xie et al.  suggests that small perturbations added in the input domain lead to substantial noise in the feature maps of the network. While the feature maps of clean images focus on semantically relevant content, the feature maps of adversarial images are even activated in the irrelevant regions.\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.6\\linewidth]{New_Images/Feature_Denoise_1.png}\n        \\caption[width = 0.7\\linewidth]{Feature maps of $res_3$ block of ImageNet-trained ResNet-50 for both the clean image(top) and adversarial image(bottom).

Adversarial Training of the classifier is performed together with the addition of a \\textit{denoising block}. The structure of the block is inspired from \\textit{self-attention}  and \\textit{Non-Local Networks} .\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.6\\linewidth]{New_Images/Feature_Denoise_2.png}\n        \\caption{Denoising Block}\n        \\label{fig:fd_2}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    Several denoising operations have been mentioned in this paper: 1) \\textbf{Non-Local Means} : For a input feature map $x$, a denoised feature map $y$ is computed by weighted mean of features in all spatial locations $\\mathcal{L}$:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\label{fd_eq}\n        y_i = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{C}(x)} \\sum_{\\forall j \\in \\mathcal{L}}f(x_i,x_j).x_j,\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $f(x_i,x_j)$ is the feature dependent weighting function and $\\mathcal{C}(x)$ is the normalization function. \n    Two Variants have been discussed- 1) \\textit{Gaussian(softmax)} sets where $f(x_i,x_j)=e^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\theta(x_i)^T \\phi(x_j)}$ and $\\mathcal{C} = \\sum_{\\forall j \\in \\mathcal{L}}f(x_i,x_j)$ and 2) \\textit{Dot Product} sets where $f(x_i,x_j)=x_{i}^{T}x_j$ and $C(x)=\\mathit{N}$ where $\\mathit{N}$ is the number of pixels in $x$. 2) \\textbf{Bilateral Filter} :It is similar to Equation[\\ref{fd_eq}] but differs from it in its neighborhood $\\Omega(i)$, which is a local region (e.g a 3X3 patch) around pixel $i$. 3) \\textbf{Mean Filter}: Simplest denoising operation is the mean filter i.e average pooling with a stride of 1. Mean filters reduce noise but also smooth structures. 4) \\textbf{Median Filter}: It is defined as $y_i = median\\{\\forall j \\in \\Omega(i):x_j\\}$ where the median is over a local region $\\Omega(i)$ and is performed separately for each channel. It is good at removing \\textit{salt and pepper} noise.\\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{Randomized Smoothing}: The goal of this defense method is to obtain a new classifier $g$ from base classifier $f$ which returns the most probable class when the input $x$ perturbed with Gaussian Noise is added to the base classifier:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        g(x) = arg max_{c \\in \\mathcal{Y}} \\hspace{1mm} \\mathbb{P}(f(x+ \\epsilon)=c), \\hspace{2mm} \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2 I)\n    \\end{equation}\n    Now $n$ samples of Gaussian noise are drawn and added to the input image $x$. These noisy samples of x are given as input to the base classifier $f$ and the class counts are obtained.\n    If $\\hat{c_A}$ and $\\hat{c_B}$ are the two classes with maximum counts $n_A$ and $n_B$ then a Binomial Hypothesis test is performed to obtain the p-value ($n_A$ $\\sim$ Binomial($n_A+n_B$,p)). If the p-value is less than a constant $\\alpha$ then return $\\hat{c_A}$ otherwise abstain from returning an output. \\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{ Hidden Space Restriction}: The authors of this paper suggest that the main reason for perturbations is the close-proximity of different class samples in the learned space. To counter this, they proposed to disentangle class-wise intermediate feature representation of deep networks i.e., force the features of each class to lie inside a convex region, which is maximally separated from the regions of other classes. For a input sample $x$ let the adversarial polytope (convex region within which the label of the input image doesn't change) be $P_{\\epsilon}(x;\\theta)={F_{\\theta}(x+\\delta) \\hspace{0.1cm}s.t.,||\\delta||_p\\leq \\epsilon }$, then $O_{\\epsilon}^{i,j}$ represents the overlap region between data pair $(i,j)$ i.e $O_{\\epsilon}^{i,j}=P_{\\epsilon}(x_{y_i}^i;\\theta)\\cap P_{\\epsilon}(x_{y_j}^j;\\theta)$. The authors propose that reducing this overlap region between different classes will result in lower adversarial success. To achieve this, the authors augment the loss function used while training. This new loss added is called \\textit{Prototype Conformity Loss}:\n    \\begin{equation}\n      \\mathcal{L}_{PC}(x,y) = \\sum_{i} \\left\\{ ||f_i-w_{y_i}^c||_2 - \\frac{1}{k-1}\\sum_{j\\neq y_i}\\left(    ||f_i-w_{j}^{c}||_2 + ||w_{y_i}^{c}-w_{j}^{c}||_2     \\right) \\right\\}  \n    \\end{equation}\n    where $f_i$ denotes the DNN output representation of image $i$ and $w_{y_i}^c$ are the trainable centroids of class $y_i$. At inference time, the label is given to an image $i$ as follows: $\\hat{y}_i = argmin_j||f_i-w_{y_j}^{c}||$. The total loss function for training the model is:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\mathcal{L}(x,y) = \\mathcal{L}_{CE}(x,y)+ \\mathcal{L}_{PC}(x,y)\n    \\end{equation}\n    Where $\\mathcal{L}_{CE}(.)$ is the cross-entropy loss. To obtain identical effect in intermediate layers, $\\mathcal{L}_{PC}(.)$ is calculated using a branch $\\mathcal{G}_{\\phi}$, which maps the features to a lower dimension. So the final loss becomes:\n    \\begin{align*}\n        \\mathcal{L} & = \\mathcal{L}_{CE} + \\sum_{l}^{L}\\mathcal{L}_{PC} \\\\\n        & where \\hspace{0.2cm} \\mathcal{L}_{PC}^l = \\mathcal{L}_{PC}(f^l,y)\\\\\n        & s.t., \\hspace{0.2cm} f^l = \\mathcal{G}_{\\phi}^l(F_{\\theta}^l(x))\n    \\end{align*}\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.7\\linewidth]{New_Images/adv_hidden_space.png}\n        \\caption{Illustration of the training procedure.}\n        \\label{fig:Hidden_space_restrict}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    \\end{itemize}", "cites": [7311, 38, 924, 917, 953, 923, 6149], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6363636363636364, "origin_cites_number": 11, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple defense techniques from different papers, connecting them under the umbrella of adversarial training.

MagNet consists of two components: 1) a \\textit{detector} which rejects examples far from the decision boundary of different classes. 2) a \\textit{reformer} which given an input $x$ strives to find\n    $x{'}$ such that $x{'}$ is a close approximation of $x$ and also is close to the normal examples manifold(decision boundary).\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h!]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.8\\linewidth]{New_Images/Magnet-model.png}\n        \\caption{Workflow of the MagNet framework during test phase}\n        \\label{fig:magnet}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    \\textbf{Detector}: The detector is the function $d: \\mathbb{S} \\rightarrow {0,1}$ which detects whether the input is adversarial. Two kinds of detector were mentioned in the literature: 1) \\textit{Detector based on Reconstruction Error} - In this an autoencoder is trained using the normal samples. The loss function minimized in this case is:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        L(\\mathbb{X}_{train}) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbb{X}_{train}|} \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{X}_{train}} ||x-ae(x)||_2\n    \\end{equation*}\n    $ae(x)$ denotes the reconstructed image obtained from the autoencoder $ae$. The reconstruction error on a test sample $x$ is:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        E(x) = ||x-ae(x)||_p \n    \\end{equation}\n    where $E(x)$ is the $l_p$ distance between input image and its reconstructed image. If $E(x)$ is greater than some constant $\\delta_p$ then the input is an adversarial example otherwise it is not. 2) \\textit{Detector based on probability divergence} - Let $f(x)$ be the output of the last layer(softmax) of the neural network $f$ given an input $x$. Then in this case probability divergence of\n    $f(x)$ and $f(ae(x))$ is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        JSD(P||Q) = \\frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(P||M) + \\frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(Q||M)\n    \\end{equation}\n    where $D_{KL}(P||Q) = \\sum_{i} P(i) log \\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}$ is the Kullback–Leibler Divergence and $M = \\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$. The Jensen–Shannon divergence is a method of measuring the similarity between two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$. $\\\\$\n    $\\\\$\n    \\textbf{Reformer}: The reformer is the function $r:\\mathbb{S} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}_t$ which tries to reconstruct the test input so that it is closer to the training data manifold. An ideal reformer: 1) should not change classification results of normal samples and 2) should change adversarial samples adequately such that the reformed samples are close to normal samples. Two kinds of reform strategies were proposed: 1) \\textit{Noise based Reformer}: a naive reformer which adds random noise to the input sampled from a Gaussian distribution i.e $r(x) = clip(x+ \\epsilon.y)$ where $y \\sim \\mathit{N}(y;0,I)$.\n    2) \\textit{Autoencoder based Reformer}: In this case the autoencoder trained for detector $ae(x)$ is used. For an input $x{'}$ the reconstruction obtained from autoencoder $ae(x{'})$ is fed to the target classifier as it is closer to the normal samples manifold.$\\\\$\n     \\item \\textbf{Feature Squeezing}: Xu et al.  argues that feature input spaces are unnecessarily large. So he proposed a mechanism to reduce the degrees of freedom available to an adversary by squeezing out unnecessary input features. \\textit{Feature Squeezing} is a simple adversarial example detection framework that compares the model's prediction on the original sample with its prediction after squeezing. If the difference is higher than a threshold value, then the sample is adversarial and is discarded.\n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.6\\linewidth]{New_Images/fs_framework.png}\n        \\caption{Feature Squeezing Framework}\n        \\label{fig:fs_model}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}\n    Two techniques have been proposed by the authors:1)\\textit{Squeezing Color Bits}: Grayscale images comprise of 8-bit pixel values, whereas color images consist of 24-bit pixels. The bit depth can be considerably reduced without much loss of information, thereby reducing the search space for adversarial samples. This is done by using a binary filter with 0.5 as the cutoff. \n    \\begin{comment}\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width = 0.6\\linewidth]{New_Images/grayscale_bit_redux.png}\n        \\caption{Image samples with bit reduction from 8 to 1. The rows are of MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet respectively.}\n        \\label{fig:gs_1}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \\end{comment}   \n    2) \\textit{Spatial Smoothing}: It is an image processing technique that is used to reduce noise. Its two variations have been mentioned:1) \\textit{Local Smoothing}: Smoothes the value of a pixel in a particular window size by using nearby pixels. In this paper, the Median Smoothing was used. 2) \\textit{ Non-Local Smoothing}: For a given image patch, non-local smoothing finds several similar patches in a larger area and then replaces the center patch with the average of those patches. \\newline\n    \\item \\textbf{Convex adversarial polytope}: In this paper, Wong et al.  proposed a method for obtaining \\textit{provably robust} ReLU classifiers. For a ReLU based neural network $f$ where $f_{\\theta} : \\mathbb{R}^{|x|} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{|y|}$, we obtain an adversarial polytope ($\\mathcal{Z}_{\\epsilon}(x)$) which is the set of all final layer activations that can be obtained by perturbing the input with $\\Delta$. Here, $\\Delta$ is $l_{\\infty}$ norm bounded by $\\epsilon$:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\mathcal{Z}_{\\epsilon}(x) = \\{f_{\\theta}(x + \\Delta): ||\\Delta||_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon \\}\n    \\end{equation}\n    Now, a \\textit{convex outer bound} on this adversarial polytope is created. If no point inside this \\textit{outer bound} changes the class label of the input, then no label is changed in the true adversarial polytope as well. This bound is obtained by solving the following linear program:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        z \\geq 0,\\hspace{1mm} z \\geq \\hat{z}, \\hspace{1mm} -u\\hat{z}+ (u-l)z \\leq -ul\n    \\end{equation}\n    Here, $u,l,\\hat{z},z$ are the lower bound, upper bound, pre ReLU activation and ReLU activation respectively. Given a dataset $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1,2,...,N}$, instead of training the model using these data points, the model is trained using the farthest points (i.e with the highest loss) from $x_i$ which are $l_{\\infty}$ by $\\epsilon$:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        minimize_{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} max_{||\\Delta||_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon} L(f_{\\theta}(x_i+\\Delta),y_i)\n    \\end{equation}\n    L is the loss function, and $\\theta$ are the parameters of the feedforward ReLU neural network. \n    \\end{itemize}", "cites": [905, 3865, 934], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a factual summary of three adversarial detection techniques (MagNet, Feature Squeezing, and Convex Adversarial Polytope) with basic explanations of their components and mechanisms.

Average \\emph{Attack Success Rates} on the ImageNet dataset are much higher as compared to MNIST and CIFAR-10 even when employing the same defense techniques. Pixel Deflection by Prakash et al.  and Randomization by Xie at al.  have the best generalizability in terms of classification.
