) and (Bidirectional-)Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM; ),\nwhich were eventually adopted into the NLP domain,\nand to the advances of using word embeddings  and contextualized word embeddings .\nBoth NN architectures and text representations have raised the state-of-the-art results in the field of text classification considerably (e.g., ).\nIf these improvements were transferrable to AL, this would result in a huge increase in efficiency.\nFor the AL practitioner, this either means achieving the same performance using fewer samples, or having an increase in performance using the same amount of data.\nAnother favorable development is that transfer learning, especially the paradigm of fine-tuning pre-trained language models (LMs), has become popular in NLP.\nIn the context of AL this helps especially in the small data scenario, in which a pre-trained model can be leveraged to train a model by fine-tuning using only little data, which would otherwise be infeasible.\nFinally, by operating on sub-word units LMs also handle out-of-vocabulary tokens, which is an advantage over many traditional methods.\nResulting from these advances, existing AL surveys have become both incomplete in some parts and outdated in others:\nThey lack comparison against the current state of the art models, do not provide results for more recent large-scale datasets, \nand most importantly, they are lacking the aforementioned advances in NNs and text representations.\nSurprisingly, despite the current popularity of NNs, there is only little research about NN-based active learning in the context of NLP, and even less thereof in the context of text classification (see Section \\ref{subsect:nn_al} and Section \\ref{subsect:active_tc} for a detailed summary).\nWe suspect this is due to the following reasons: \n(1) Many DL models are known to require large amounts of data ,\nwhich is in strong contrast to AL aiming at requiring as little data as possible\n(2) there is a whole AL scenario based on artificial data generation, which unfortunately is a lot more challenging for text in contrast to for example images, for which data augmentation is commonly used in classification tasks ;\n(3) NNs are lacking uncertainty information regarding their predictions \\revised{(as explained in Section \\ref{subsect:nn_al})}, which complicates the use of a whole prominent class of query strategies.\n\\hiddennotes{\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item No clear evaluation protocol / huge differences in the evaluation approaches\n  \\end{itemize}\n}\nThis survey aims at summarizing the existing approaches of (D)NN-based AL for text classification.\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item We provide a taxonomy of query strategies and classify strategies relevant for AL for text classification.\n  \\item We survey existing work at the intersection of AL, text classification, and (D)NNs.\n  \\item Recent advances in text classification are summarized and related to the AL process.
