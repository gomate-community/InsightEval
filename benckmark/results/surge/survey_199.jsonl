Because the raw textual data necessary to train LMs is available in abundance, these LMs can be trained on large datasets, in the process learning robust general-purpose features of the language it is modeling.\nThe above pre-trained LM will be then adapted to different downstream tasks by introducing additional parameters and \\term{fine-tuning} them using task-specific objective functions.\nWithin this paradigm, the focus turned mainly to \\term{objective engineering}, designing the training objectives used at both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. For example,  show that introducing a loss function of predicting salient sentences from a document will lead to a better pre-trained model for text summarization.\nNotably, the main body of the pre-trained LM is generally (but not always; ) fine-tuned as well to make it more suitable for solving the downstream task.\nNow, as of this writing in 2021, we are in the middle of a second sea change, in which the ``pre-train, fine-tune'' procedure is replaced by one in which we dub ``\\term{pre-train, prompt, and predict}''.\nIn this paradigm, instead of adapting pre-trained LMs to downstream tasks via objective engineering, downstream tasks are reformulated to look more like those solved during the original LM training with the help of a textual \\term{prompt}.\nFor example, when recognizing the emotion of a social media post, ``I missed the bus today.'', we may continue with a prompt ``I felt so \\underline{\\hspace*{0.5cm}}'', and ask the LM to fill the blank with an emotion-bearing word.\nOr if we choose the prompt ``English: I missed the bus today. French: \\underline{\\hspace*{0.5cm}}''), an LM may be able to fill in the blank with a French translation.\nIn this way, by selecting the appropriate prompts we can manipulate the model behavior so that the pre-trained LM itself can be used to \\term{predict} the desired output, sometimes even without any additional task-specific training (Tab.~\\ref{table:intro} d.; e.g.~).\nThe advantage of this method is that, given a suite of appropriate prompts, a single LM trained in an entirely unsupervised fashion can be used to solve a great number of tasks . \nHowever, as with most conceptually enticing prospects, there is a catch -- this method introduces the necessity for \\term{prompt engineering}, finding the most appropriate prompt to allow a LM to solve the task at hand.\nThis survey attempts to organize the current state of knowledge in this rapidly developing field by providing an overview and formal definition of prompting methods (\\S\\ref{sec:2-formal-description}), and an overview of the pre-trained language models that use these prompts (\\S\\ref{sec:lm}).\nThis is followed by in-depth discussion of prompting methods, from basics such as prompt engineering (\\S\\ref{sec:4-prompt-template-engineering}) and answer engineering (\\S\\ref{sec:5-prompt-answer-engineering}) to more advanced concepts such as multi-prompt learning methods (\\S\\ref{sec:6-multi-prompt-learning}) and prompt-aware training methods (\\S\\ref{sec:tuning}).\nWe then organize the various applications to which prompt-based learning methods have been applied, and discuss how they interact with the choice of prompting method (\\S\\ref{sec:applications}).\nFinally, we attempt to situate the current state of prompting methods in the research ecosystem, making connections to other research fields (\\S\\ref{sec:related}), suggesting some current challenging problems that may be ripe for further research (\\S\\ref{sec:challenges}), and performing a meta-analysis of current research trends (\\S\\ref{sec:meta-analysis}).\nFinally, in order to help beginners who are interested in this field  learn more effectively, we highlight some systematic  resources about prompt learning (as well as pre-training) provided both within this survey and on companion websites:\n\\begin{itemize*}\n    \\item \\includegraphics[scale=0.01]{fig/IntroFig/logo.png}: A \n    \\href{http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/}{website } of prompt-based learning that contains: frequent updates to this survey, related slides, etc.\n    \\item Fig.\\ref{fig:typo-prompt}: A typology of important concepts for prompt-based learning.\n    \\item Tab.\\ref{tab:papers-part1}: A systematic and comprehensive comparison among different prompting methods.  \n    \\item Tab.\\ref{tab:task-prompt}: An organization of commonly-used prompts.\n    \\item Tab.\\ref{tab:timeline}: A timeline of prompt-based research works.\n    \\item Tab.\\ref{tab:pretrained-aspect}: A systematic and comprehensive comparison among different pre-trained LMs.    \n\\end{itemize*}\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\setlength\\tabcolsep{15pt}\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.3}\n\\begin{tabular}{llc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Paradigm}                                                    & \\textbf{Engineering}                   & \\textbf{Task Relation}           \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\multirow{4}{4cm}{a.

For example, if the final answered prompt has a positive label, then this will bias the model towards predicting positive words. To overcome those pitfalls,  first use context-free input (e.g. the prompt would be ``Input: Subpar acting. Sentiment: Negative\\textbackslash n Input: Beautiful film. Sentiment: Positive\\textbackslash n Input: N/A. Sentiment:\") to get the initial probability distribution $P_0$, then they use the real input (e.g. the prompt would be ``Input: Subpar acting. Sentiment: Negative\\textbackslash n Input: Beautiful film. Sentiment: Positive\\textbackslash n Input: Amazing. Sentiment:\") to get the probability distribution $P_1$. Finally, these two distributions can be used to get a calibrated generation probability distribution. However, this method has two drawbacks: (1) it comes with the overhead of finding proper context-free input (e.g.~whether to use ``N/A\" or ``None\") and (2) the probability distribution of the underlying pre-trained LM is still not calibrated.\nEven though we have a calibrated probability distribution, we also need to be careful when we assume a single gold answer for an input. This is because that all surface forms of a same object will compete for finite probability mass~. For example, if we consider the gold answer to be ``Whirlpool bath\", the generation probability of it will typically be low since the word ``Bathtub\" shares the same meaning and it will take over a large probability mass.
