Recent years have seen a surge in the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in automating various facets of science, business, and social workflow. The surge is partly due to the uptick of research in a field of ML, called Deep Learning (DL), where thousands (even billions) of neuronal parameters are trained to generalize on carrying out a particular task. Successful use of DL algorithms in healthcare , ophthalmology , developmental disorders , in autonomous robots and vehicles , in image processing classification and detection , in speech and audio processing , cyber-security , and many more indicate the reach of DL algorithms in our daily lives. \nEasier access to high-performance compute nodes using cloud computing ecosystems, high-throughput AI accelerators to enhance performance, and access to big-data scale datasets and storage enables deep learning providers to research, test, and operate ML algorithms at scale in small edge devices , smartphones , and AI-based web-services using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for wider exposure to any applications.\nThe large number of parameters in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make them complex to understand and undeniably harder to interpret. Regardless of the cross-validation accuracy or other evaluation parameters which might indicate a good learning performance, deep learning (DL) models could inherently learn or fail to learn representations from the data which a human might consider important. Explaining the decisions made by DNNs require knowledge of the internal operations of DNNs, missing with non-AI-experts and end-users who are more focused on getting accurate solution. Hence, often the ability to interpret AI decisions are deemed secondary in the race to achieve state-of-the-art results or crossing human-level accuracy. \nRecent interest in XAI, even from governments especially with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  regulation, shows the important realization of the ethics , trust , bias  of AI, as well as the impact of adversarial examples  in fooling classifier decisions. \nIn , Miller et al. describes that curiosity is one of the primary reason why people ask for explanations to specific decisions. Another reason might be to facilitate better learning - to reiterate model design and generate better results. Each explanation should be consistent across similar data points and generate stable or similar explanation on the same data point over time . Explanations should make the AI algorithm expressive to improve human understanding, confidence in decision making, and promote impartial and just decisions. Thus, in order to maintain transparency, trust, and fairness in the ML decision-making process, an explanation or an interpretable solution is required for ML systems.\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\footnotesize\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[\n        level 1/.style={sibling distance=18em},\n        edge from parent/.style={->,draw},\n        >=latex]\n        \\node[root] {XAI}\n        child {node[level 2] (c1) {\\textbf{Scope}: Where is the XAI method focusing on?

For a cancer detection model using microscopic images, an explanation might mean a map of input pixels which contribute to the model output. For a speech recognition model, an explanation might be the power spectrum information during a specific time which contributed more towards the current output decision. Explanations can be also based on the parameters or activations of the trained models explained either by using surrogates such as decision trees or by using gradients or other methods. In the context of reinforcement learning algorithms, an explanation might be given as to why an agent made a certain decision over another. However, the definitions of interpretable and explainable AI are often generic and might be misleading  and should integrate some form of reasoning . \nA collection of AI models, such as decision-trees and rule-based models, is inherently interpretable. However, there are affected by the drawbacks of Interpretability-versus-Accuracy trade-off compared to the Deep Learning models.  This paper discusses the different approaches and perspectives of researchers to address the problem of the explainability of deep learning algorithms. Methods can be used effectively if the model parameters and architecture are already known. However, modern API-based AI services produce more challenges because of the relative `black-box'  nature of the problem where the end-user has information only on the input provided to the deep learning model and not the model itself. \nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of explainable and interpretable algorithms with a timeline of important events and research publications into three well-defined taxonomies as illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:surveycategory}. Unlike many other surveys which only categorize and summarize the published research in a high-level, we provide additional mathematical overviews and algorithms of seminal works in the field of XAI. The algorithms presented in the survey are clustered into three well-defined categories which are described in detail in the following sections. Various evaluation techniques for XAI presented in literature are also discussed along with discussion on the limitations and future directions of these methods. \nOur contributions can be summarized as the following:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item In order to systematically analyze explainable and interpretable algorithms in deep learning, we taxonomize XAI to three well-defined categories to improve clarity and accessibility of the approaches.\n    \\item We examine, summarize and classify the core mathematical model and algorithms of recent XAI research on the proposed taxonomy and discuss the timeline for seminal work.\n    \\item We generate and compare the explanation maps for eight different XAI algorithms, outline the limitations of this approach, and discuss potential future directions to improve trust, transparency, and bias and fairness using deep neural network explanations.\n\\end{enumerate}\nOur survey is based on published research, from the year 2007 to 2020, from various search sources including Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEEXplore, ScienceDirect, Spinger, and preprints from arXiv.

Even though there are different facets to why XAI is important, our study suggests that the most important concerns are three-fold: 1) trustability, 2) transparency, and 3) bias and fairness of AI algorithms. Current business models include interpretation as a step before serving the ML models on production systems, however are often limited to small tree-based models. With the use of highly non-linear deep learning algorithms with millions of parameters in ML pipelines, XAI techniques must improve all three concerns mentioned above.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{images/adversarial_example.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Illustration from  showing an adversarial attack where an image class Panda is deliberately attacked to predict as a Gibbon with high confidence.

Here, transparency can be a part of the algorithm itself or using external means such as model decomposition or simulations.}\n    Transparency is important to assess the quality of output predictions and to ward off adversaries. An adversarial example could hinder accurate decision making capabilities of a classifier by fooling the classifier into believing that a fake image is infact real. Figure \\ref{fig:adversarial} illustrates such an example where an image of a Panda is predicted as a Gibbon with high confidence after the original Panda image was tampered by adding some adversarial noise. Figure \\ref{fig:sourcetagmiss} illustrates a classifier learning to classify based on text data such as source tags or watermarks in advertisements in images. As we rely more on autonomous algorithms to aid our daily lives, quality of AI algorithms to mitigate attacks  and provide transparency in terms of model understanding, textual, or visual reports should be of prime importance. \n    \\item \\textbf{Improves Trust}: As a social animal, our social lives, decisions, and judgements are primarily based on the knowledge and available explanations to situations and the trust we generate. A scientific explanation or logical reasoning for a sub-optimal decision is better than a highly confident decision without any explanations.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{images/whyxai.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Significant expected improvements when using XAI techniques to support decision making of end-users.

The propagation follows a strict conservation property whereby a equal redistribution of relevance received by a neuron must be enforced. In CNNs, LRP backpropagates information regarding relevance of output class back to input layer, layer-by-layer. In Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), relevance is propagated to hidden states and memory cell. Zero relevance is assigned to gates of the RNN.

To derive a representation that is understandable by humans, LIME tries to find importance of contiguous superpixels (a patch of pixels) in a source image towards the output class. Hence, LIME finds a binary vector \\bm{$x^{'} \\in \\{0,1\\}$} to represent the presence or absence of a continuous path or 'superpixel' that provides the highest representation towards class output. This works on a patch-level on a single data input. Hence, the method falls under local explanations. There is also a global explanation model based on LIME called SP-LIME described in the global explainable model sub section. Here, we focus on local explanations.\n\\begin{algorithm}[!b]\n    \\small\n    \\caption{LIME algorithm for local explanations}\n    \\label{alg:limelocal}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n    \\Statex \\textbf{Input:} classifier \\bm{$f$}, input sample \\bm{$x$}, number of superpixels \\bm{$n$}, number of features to pick \\bm{$m$}\n    \\Statex \\textbf{Output:} explainable coefficients from the linear model\n    \\State \\bm{$\\Bar{y} \\leftarrow f.\\texttt{predict(}x\\texttt{)}$}\n    \\For {i in \\bm{$n$}}\n        \\State \\bm{$p_i \\leftarrow \\texttt{Permute(}x\\texttt{)}$} \\Comment{Randomly pick superpixels}\n        \\State \\bm{$obs_i \\leftarrow f.\\texttt{predict(}p\\texttt{)}$}\n        \\State \\bm{$dist_i \\leftarrow |\\Bar{y}-obs_i|$}\n    \\EndFor\n    \\State \\bm{$simscore \\leftarrow  \\texttt{SimilarityScore(}dist\\texttt{)}$}\n    \\State \\bm{$x_{pick} \\leftarrow \\texttt{Pick(}p, simscore, m\\texttt{)}$}\n    \\State \\bm{$L \\leftarrow \\texttt{LinearModel.fit(}p,m,simscore\\texttt{)}$}\n    \\State return \\bm{$L$}.weights\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{images/lime_example.png}\n\\end{center}\n  \\caption{Local explanations of an image classification prediction described using LIME .

Here, \\bm{$g$} can be decision trees, linear models, or other models of varying interpretability. \nLet explanation complexity be measured by \\bm{$\\Omega(g)$}. \nIf \\bm{$\\pi_x(z)$} is a proximity measure between two instances \\bm{$x$} and $z$ around \\bm{$x$}, and \\bm{$\\mathcal{L}(f, g, \\pi_x)$} represents faithfulness of \\bm{$g$} in approximating \\bm{$f$} in locality defined by \\bm{$\\pi_x$}, then, explanation \\bm{$\\EModel$} for the input data sample \\bm{$x$} is given by the LIME equation:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:limeeq}\n\\EModel(x) = \\argmin_{g \\in G}\\;\\;\\mathcal{L}(f, g, \\pi_x) + \\Omega(g)\n\\end{equation}\nNow, in Equation \\ref{eq:limeeq}, the goal of LIME optimization is to minimize the locality-aware loss \\bm{$\\mathcal{L}(f, g, \\pi_x)$} in a model agnostic way. Example visualization of LIME algorithm on a single instance is illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:lime}. Algorithm \\ref{alg:limelocal} shows the steps to explain the model for a single input sample and the overall procedure of LIME. Here, for the input instance we permute data by finding a superpixel of information (`fake' data). Then, we calculate distance (similarity score) between permutations and original observations. Now, we know how different the class scores are for the original input and the new `fake' data.\nWe can then make predictions on new `fake' data using the complex model $f$. This depends on the amount of superpixels you choose from the original data. The most descriptive feature can be picked which improved prediction on the permuted data. If we fit a simple model, often times a locally weighted regression model, to the permuted data with \\bm{$m$} features and similarity scores as weights, we can use the feature weights, or coefficients, from the simple model to make explanations for the local behavior of the complex model. Recent years have seen many research improving and extending the LIME algorithm to a variety of new tasks. We summarize a few of them below:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item In , Mishra et al. extended LIME algorithm to music content analysis by temporal segmentation, and frequency and time-frequency segmentation of input mel-spectogram. Their approach was called Sound-LIME (SLIME) and was applied to explain the predictions of a deep vocal detector. \n    \\item In , Tomi Peltola described a Kullback–Leibler divergence based LIME called KL-LIME to explain Bayesian predictive models. Similar to LIME, the explanations are generated using an interpretable model, whose parameters are found by minimizing the KL-divergence from the predictive model. Thus, local interpretable explanations are generated by projecting information from the predictive distribution to a simpler interpretable probabilistic explanation model.\n    \\item In , Rehman et al. used agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms to replace the random perturbation of the LIME algorithm. Here, authors use the HC method to group training data together as clusters and the KNN is used to find closest neighbors to a test instance. Once the KNN picks a cluster, that cluster is passed as the input data perturbation instead of a random perturbation as in LIME algorithm. Authors report that their approach generates model explanations which are more stable than traditional LIME algorithm.\n    \\item In , Bramhall et al. adjusted the linear relations of LIME to consider non-linear relationships using a quadratic approximation framework called Quadratic-LIME (QLIME). They achieve this by considering the linear approximations as tangentials steps within a complex function. Results on a global staffing company dataset suggests that the mean square loss (MSE) of LIME's linear relationship at local level improves while using QLIME. \n    \\item In , Shi et al. introduced a replacement method to pick superpixels of information for image data using Modified Perturbed Sampling operation for LIME (MPS-LIME). Authors converted the traditional superpixel picking operation into a clique set construction problem by converting the superpixels to an undirected graph. The clique operation improves the runtime due to a considerable reduction in the number of perturbed samples in the MPS-LIME method. Authors compared their method with LIME using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of determination $R^2$ and reported better results in terms of understandability, fidelity, and efficiency.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [6083], "cite_extract_rate": 0.16666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a clear synthesis of the LIME method and its extensions, connecting multiple cited papers to illustrate variations and improvements in the algorithm.

Here, if we consider the machine learning model \\bm{$f(.)$} as a vector space \\bm{$E_m$} spanned by basis vector \\bm{$e_m$}, we see that human understanding can be modelled as vector space \\bm{$E_h$} and implicit vectors \\bm{$e_h$} which correspond to human-understandable concepts \\bm{$C$}. Hence, the explanation function of the model in a global sense, \\bm{$g$}, becomes \\bm{$g: E_m \\rightarrow E_h$}.\nNow, human understandable concepts are generated from either input features of training data or user-provided data to simplify the lower-level features of the input domain. For example, a zebra can be deduced to positive concepts \\bm{$P_C$} such as stripes as illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:tcav}. A negative set of concepts, $N$, can be gathered, for example a set of random photos, to contrast the concepts for zebra. Layer activations for layer \\bm{$j$} of \\bm{$f$}, \\bm{$z_j$} is calculated for both positive and negative concepts. The set of activations are trained using a binary classifier to distinguish between: \n\\bm{$\\{f_j(\\bm{x}) : \\bm{x} \\in P_C\\}$} and\n\\bm{$\\{f_j(\\bm{x}) : \\bm{x} \\in N\\}$}.\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{images/tcav.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n  \\caption{Figure illustrates the TCAV process  where (a) describe random concepts and examples, (b) labelled examples from training data, (c) trained neural network, (d) linear model segregating the activations extracted from specific layers in the neural network for the concepts and random examples, and (e) finding conceptual sensitivity using directional derivatives.}\n\\label{fig:tcav}\n\\end{figure*}\nAuthors proposed a new method, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), which uses directional derivatives similar to gradient based methods to evaluate the sensitivity of class predictions of \\bm{$f$} to the changes in given inputs towards the direction of the concept \\bm{$C$} for a specific layer \\bm{$j$}. If \\bm{$h(j,k)$} is the logit of layer \\bm{$j$} for class \\bm{$k$} for a particular input, conceptual sensitivity of a class \\bm{$k$} to \\bm{$C$} can be computed as directional derivative \\bm{$S_{C,k,j}(\\bm{x})$} for a concept vector \\bm{$\\bm{v}_C^j \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{C,k,j}(\\bm{x}) & = &\n\\lim\\limits_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{h_{j, k}(z_j(\\bm{x}) + \\epsilon \\bm{v}_C^j) - h_{j,k}(z_j(\\bm{x}))}{\\epsilon} \n\\nonumber \\\\\n& = & \\nabla h_{j,k}(z_j(\\bm{x})) \\cdot \\bm{v}_C^j ,\n\\vspace*{-2ex}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nA TCAV score can be calculated to find the influence of inputs towards \\bm{$C$}. If \\bm{$X_k$} denotes all inputs with label \\bm{$k$}, TCAV score is given by:\n\\begin{equation}\n TCAV_{C, k, j} = \\frac{\\left\\lvert \\left\\{ \n                    \\bm{x}\\in X_k : \n                    S_{C,k,j}(\\bm{x}) > 0 \n                    \\right\\} \\right\\rvert}\n                   {\\left\\lvert X_k \\right\\rvert}\n\\end{equation}\nTCAV unfortunately could generate meaningless CAVs if the input concepts are not picked properly. For example, input concepts generated randomly would inherently generate bad linear models for binary classification and thus TCAV score wouldn't be a good identifier for global explainability. Also, concepts with high correlations or shared objects in the data, such as cars and roads, could decrease the efficiency of TCAV method. Human bias in picking the concepts also is a considerable disadvantage of using concepts for explainability. The CAV method was further improved in numerous research papers which involved the primary author of CAV :\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item In , Ghorbani et al. described a method called  Automatic Concept-based Explanations (ACE) to globally explain a trained classifier without human supervision unlike TCAV method. Here, authors carry out a multi-resolution segmentation of instance to be explained. This generates multiple resolution segments from the same class. All segments are reshaped to similar input sizes and activations of each segment is found with respect to a specific chosen bottleneck layer. Clustering the activations and removing outliers reveals similarities within activations. \n    TCAV scores of individual concepts provide an importance score of the same for particular classification. Authors carried out human subject experiments to evaluate their method and found inspiring results. One research question that arise is the importance of clusters in decision-making. Authors showed that, by stitching the clustered concepts together as an image, a trained InceptionV3 deep neural network was capable of classifying the stitched image as the correct class category. This tends to show that the extracted concepts are suitable for decision-making within the deep learning model.\n    \\item Work done by Goyal et al.  improved TCAV method by proposing a Causal Concept Effect (CaCE) model which looks at the causal effect of presence or absence of high-level concepts towards deep learning model's prediction. Methods such as TCAVs can suffer from confounding of concepts which could happen if the training data instances have multiple classes in them, even with low correlation between the classes. Also, biases in dataset could influence concepts, as well as colors in the input data.\n    CaCE can be computed exactly if we can change concepts of interest by intervening the counterfactual data generation. Authors call this Ground truth CaCE (GT-CaCE) and also elaborate a way to estimate CaCE using Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) called VAE-CaCE. Experimental results on four datasets suggest improved clustering and performance of the CaCE method even when there are biases or correlations in the dataset.\n    \\item In , Yeh et al. introduced ConceptSHAP to define an importance or ``completeness\" score for each discovered concept. Similar to ACE method mentioned earlier, one of the aims of ConceptSHAP is to have concepts consistently clustered to certain coherent spatial regions. However, ConceptSHAP finds the importance of each individual concepts with high completeness score from a set of $m$ concept vectors \\bm{$C_s = \\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_m\\}$} by utilizing Shapley values for importance attribution.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [1816, 8080], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 4.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section integrates and explains the concept of CAVs and TCAV, while also connecting it to subsequent improvements such as ACE and CaCE.

The relevance maps are downsized to uniform shape and size to improve computation overhead and generate tractable solutions. Spectral cluster analysis (SC) is carried out on the LRP attribution relevance maps to cluster the local explanations in a high-dimensional space. An eigenmap analysis is carried out to find relevant clusters by finding the eigengap (difference in two eigenvalues) of successive clusters. After completion, important clusters are returned to users. The clusters can be optionally visualized using t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualizations.\n\\begin{algorithm}[ht]\n    \\small\n    \\caption{SpRAy Analysis Algorithm on LRP Attributions}\n    \\label{alg:spary}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n    \\Statex \\textbf{Input:} classifier \\bm{$f$}, input samples \\bm{$x^{(1)}, \\ldots, x^{(n)}$}\n    \\Statex \\textbf{Output:} clustered input samples\n    \\For {\\bm{$x^{(i)} \\in X$}}\n        \\State \\bm{$f_{SpRAy} \\leftarrow LRP(f, x^{(i)})$}\n    \\EndFor\n    \\State \\texttt{Reshape} \\bm{$f_{SpRAy}$}\n    \\State \\bm{$clusters \\leftarrow SC(f_{SpRAy})$}\n    \\State \\bm{$clusters^* \\leftarrow \\texttt{EigenMapAnalysis(} clusters \\texttt{)}$ }\n    \\State \\texttt{Return} \\bm{$clusters^*$}\n    \\State \\texttt{Optional: Visualize t-SNE(}\\bm{$clusters^*$}\\texttt{)}\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}", "cites": [7514], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 1, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a clear, step-by-step description of the SpRAy technique and its algorithm, but it largely summarizes the method without connecting it to broader themes or contrasting it with other XAI approaches.

Built as an extension to generalized additive models (GAM), NAM instead use deep learning based neural networks to learn non-linear patterns and feature jumping which traditional tree-based GAMs cannot learn. NAMs improved accurate GAMs introduced in  and are scalable during training to several GPUs. \nConsider a general GAM of the form:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:GAM}\ng(\\mathbb{E}[y])=\\beta+f_{1}\\left(x_{1}\\right)+f_{2}\\left(x_{2}\\right)+\\cdots+f_{K}\\left(x_{K}\\right)\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\bm{$f_i$} is a univariate shape function with \\bm{$\\mathbb{E}[f_i] = 0$}, \\bm{$x \\in x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_K$} is the input with K features, \\bm{$y$} is the target variable, and \\bm{$g(.)$} is a link function.

Here, a pixel is salient if a group of neighboring pixels are distinct and different from other pixel patches in the same and multiple scales. This is done to differentiate between background and foreground layers of the image. \nTo aid visualization, a canny-edge based detector is superimposed with the SR map to provide context to the explanation. We place SR in gradient based methods due to the use of LRP. Other relevance propagation methods based on Taylor decomposition  are also explored in literature, which are slightly different in the methodology but have the same global idea.\nAlgorithm \\ref{alg:sr} describes the SR map generation in detail. Similar to SpRAy technique, we start with the LRP of the input instance. In contrast, we only find LRP attribution relevance score for a single input of interest $x$.

However, in , authors proposed Integrated Gradients (IG) and argue that most gradient based lack in certain `axioms' which are desirable characteristics of any gradient based technique. Authors argue that methods such as DeepLift , Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) , Deconvolutional networks (DeConvNets) , and Guided back-propagation  have specific back-propagation logic that violates some axioms.\nFor each input data instance $x$, if we consider a baseline instance $x^{'} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the attributions of $x$ on model $f$ can be summarized by computing the integral of gradients at all points of a straight-line path from baseline $x^{'}$ to $x$. This method is called the Integrated Gradients such that:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:intgrad}\n\\small\n\\text {IG}_j(x, x^{\\prime}) := (x_{j}-x^{\\prime}_{j})\\times\\int_{\\alpha=0}^{1} \\tfrac{\\partial F(x^{\\prime} + \\alpha\\times(x-x^{\\prime}))}{\\partial x_{j}  }~d\\alpha\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $j$ describes the dimension along which the gradient is calculated. \nDuring calculation in computers, the integral in equation \\ref{eq:intgrad} is efficiently approximated using summation instead.\nIn many cases, baseline instance $x^{'}_i$ is chosen as a zero matrix or vector. For example, for image domain, the baseline image is chosen as a black image by default. For text classification, the baseline is a zero valued vector. However, choosing baselines arbitrarily could cause issues downstream. For example, a black baseline image could cause the attribution method to diminish the importance of black pixels in the source image.\nAttribution prior  concept tries to regularize the feature attributions during model training to encode domain knowledge. A new method, Expected Gradients (EG) was also introduced in the paper as a substitute feature attribution method instead of Integrated Gradients. Together, the attribution prior and EG methods encodes prior knowledge from the domain to aid training process leading to better model interpretability. Equation \\ref{eq:expgrad} shows how authors remove the influence of baseline images from integrated gradients by still following all the axioms of Integrated Gradient method. Here, $D$ is the distribution of underlying data domain.\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:expgrad}\n\\small\n\\begin{split}\n\\text {EG}(x):=\\int_{x^{\\prime}}\\left(\\left(x_{j}-x_{j}^{\\prime}\\right) \\int_{\\alpha=0}^{1} \\tfrac{\\delta f\\left(x^{\\prime}+\\alpha \\times\\left(x-x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)}{\\delta x_j} \\delta \\alpha\\right)\\\\ . p_{D}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) \\delta x^{\\prime}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nSince an integration over the whole training distribution is intractable, authors proposed to reformulate the integral as expectations such that:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:expgrad2}\n\\small\n\\begin{split}\n\\text { EG}(x):=\\underset{x^{\\prime} \\sim D, \\alpha \\sim U(0,1)}{\\mathbb{E}}\\left[\\left(x_{j}-x_{j}^{\\prime}\\right) \\tfrac{\\delta f\\left(x^{\\prime}+\\alpha \\times\\left(x-x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)}{\\delta x_{j}}\\right]\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}", "cites": [6086, 6078, 1824, 8600, 1812], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7142857142857143, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 4.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple gradient-based attribution methods and links them through the concept of axioms, as introduced in the seminal work on Integrated Gradients.

For simple functions such as $f(x) = 1 - ReLU(1-x)$, the function value saturates for $x$ values greater than or equal to one. Hence, if we take simple gradients as an attribution method, sensitivity won't hold.\n    \\item \\textbf{Implementation invariance: } \\textit{Two networks are \\emph{functionally equivalent} if their outputs are equal for all inputs, despite having very different implementations. Attribution methods should satisfy \\emph{Implementation Invariance}, i.e., the attributions are always identical for two functionally equivalent networks .} Methods such as DeepLift and LRP break implementation invariance because they use discrete gradients, and chain rule doesn't old for discrete gradients in general. Generally, if the model fails to provide implementation invariance, the attributions are potentially sensitive to unimportant features and aspects of the model definition.\n    \\item \\textbf{Completeness: } Attributions should add up to the difference between output of model function $f$ for the input image $x$ and another baseline image $x^{'}$. $\\Sigma_{i=1}^n Gradients_i(x) = f(x) - f(x^{'})$.\n    \\item \\textbf{Linearity: } For a linearly composed neural network model $f_3$ which is a linear combination of two neural network models $f_1$ and $f_2$ such that $f_3 = a \\times f_1 + b \\times f_2$, then the attributions of the $f_3$ is expected to be a weighted sum of attributions for $f_1$ and $f_2$ with weights $a$ and $b$ respectively.\n\\end{enumerate}\nDespite human understandable explanations, gradient-based explanation maps have practical disadvantages and raises various concerns in mission-critical applications.

A black box means the XAI algorithm doesn't know the internal operations and model architectures. In white box XAI, algorithms have access to the model architecture and layer structures. Post-hoc explanation methodology is extremely useful as existing accurate models can benefit from added interpretability. Most post-hoc XAI algorithms are hence model-agnostic such that the XAI algorithm will work on any network architectures as illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:posthocmodel}. This is one of the main advantages of post-hoc explainable algorithms.

We present here some of the evaluation techniques that are actively gaining traction from the research community:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{System Causability Scale (SCS):}\nAs the explainability methods are applied to human-facing AI systems which does automated analysis of data, evaluation of human-AI interfaces as a whole is also important. A System Causability Scale (SCS) was introduced in  to understand the requirements for explanations of a user-facing human-AI machine-interface, which are often domain specific. Authors described a medical scenario where the SCS tool was applied to Framingham Risk Tool (FRT) to understand the influence and importance of specific characteristics of the human-AI interface.\n\\item{Benchmarking Attribution Methods (BAM):}\nIn a preprint publication,  introduced a framework called Benchmarking Attribution Methods (BAM) to evaluate the correctness of feature attributions and their relative importance. A BAM dataset and several models were introduced. Here, the BAM dataset is generated by copying pixel groups, called Common Features (CF), representing object categories from MSCOCO dataset  and pasting them to MiniPlaces dataset. The hypothesis is that, if we have the same pixel group of information in the same spatial location of all of $X$, then the model should ignore it as a feature of relative importance. Hence, attribution methods focusing on pasted objects are simply not doing a good job at enhancing feature attributions of important features. Authors provided model contrast score (MCS) to compare relative feature importance between difference models, input dependence rate (IDR) to learn the dependence of CF on a single instance, and input independence rate (IIR) as a percentage score of images whose average feature attributions $g_r \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for region $r$ with and without CF is less than a set threshold.\n\\item{Faithfulness and Monotonicity:}\nIn , authors described a metric, named Faithfullness, to evaluate the correlation between importance scores of features to the performance effect of each feature towards a correct prediction. By incrementally removing important features and predicting on the edited data instance, we measures the effect of feature importance and later compare it against the interpreter's own prediction of relevance. \nIn , authors introduce monotonic attribute functions and thus the Monotonicity metric which measures the importance or effect of individual data features on the performance of the model by incrementally adding each feature in the increasing order of importance to find model performance. The model performance is expected to increase as more important features are added.\n\\item{Human-grounded Evaluation Benchmark:}\nIn , Moshseni et al. introduced a human-grounded evaluation benchmark to evaluate local explanations generated by an XAI algorithm. Authors created a subset of ImageNet dataset  and asked human annotators to manually annotate the images for the particular classes. A weighted explanation map was generated which summarized an average human representation of explanations. By comparing the explanations generated by locally explainable algorithms, authors presented a method to understand the precision of XAI explanations compared to human generated explanations. One fundamental flaw of this method could be added human bias in the explanations. However, human labels of individual data points from a large population could nullify the effect of inherent bias.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{images/evaluationxai.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n    \\caption{We evaluate different gradient-based and perturbation-based techniques in this figure.

Here, each row starts with an original image from ImageNet followed by explanation map generated by gradient algorithms such as 1) saliency maps, 2) gradient times input, 3) integrated gradients, 4) LRP, 5) DeepLIFT, and 6) GradCAM, and perturbation-based techniques such as 1) LIME and 2) SHAP. \nGradCAM generates a heatmap of values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 means no influence and 1 means highest influence of individual pixels towards the model output decision. Similarly, SHAP method follows a scale for SHAP values. However, SHAP scale ranges from -0.3 to +0.3 indicating that negative values decrease output class probability and positive values increase the output class probability for the corresponding input. Here 0.3 is the largest SHAP value generated for the set of four images considered. Gradient visualizations of this figure are created using DeepExplain package while visualizations for Grad-CAM, LIME, and SHAP are created by their own individual implementations.\nOriginal image column of row (a) in Figure \\ref{fig:evaluatioxai} indicates a correct prediction of an image of a Koala with $94.5\\%$ prediction accuracy, row (b) indicates a correct prediction of a sandbar image with $38.0\\%$ accuracy, row (c) indicates an incorrect prediction of a horse as an arabian camel with $17.4\\%$ accuracy, and row (d) indicates correct prediction of a leaf beetle with $95.5\\%$ percentage accuracy.

We see that small perturbations doesn't affect the accuracy of predictions. However, feature importance maps are highly affected by the small changes.

This is apparent in the images with lower class probabilities. For example, in row (b), we can verify that the integrated gradients generated high attributions around the sandy beach, plastic chairs, and a little bit of the blue sky. As human evaluators, we can make sense of this output because human experience suggests that a sandbar involve a beach, hopefully on a sunny day with bright blue clouds. A stark difference is apparent in Grad-CAM visualizations where the class output generated a heatmap which is focused primarily on the plastic chair and sandy beach, without much emphasis on the clouds. Perturbation-based methods such as LIME and SHAP generated superpixels which maximized the class probability. Here, we see that LIME is focusing on primarily the chairs and the sky, whereas SHAP is focusing on the beach and the sky. We also note that SHAP values generated are very low, indicating lesser influence to the confidence score.", "cites": [6090], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 2, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information by integrating explanation maps from multiple XAI techniques into a visual comparison, providing a coherent narrative on their relative strengths and weaknesses.

This suggests that the further use of visualization techniques for mission-critical applications must be reconsidered moving forward. Also, better ways of representing and presenting explanations should be considered. For example, in , Weerts et al. studied the impact of SHAP explanations in improving human performance for alert processing tasks. The authors presented a human-grounded study to evaluate whether certain decision-making scenarios can be improved by providing explanations to decisions. Results showed that additional SHAP explanations to class output probability did not improve the decision-making of individuals. Authors saw more interest in final class score for making decisions which could be catastrophic in mission-critical scenarios.\nSimilarly, in , Mohseni et al. presented a human-grounded evaluation benchmark and evaluated performance of LIME algorithm by comparing the explanation map generated by LIME to that of weighted explanation map of 10 human annotations. Results suggested that LIME creates some attributions irrelevant to human explanations which causes low explanation precision compared to weighted explanation map generated by human annotators. This sheds light to the importance of understanding the mode of explanations as application-grounded, human-grounded, and functionally-grounded explanations  to improve explanation maps by meta information generated by humans, adding more constraints to explanations, or introducing formal definitions of explanations to the optimization problem.\nSeveral other flaws of explanation map visualization are explained by researchers in recent publications. In , Ghorbani et al. showed that small perturbations on the input instance generate large changes in the output interpretations that popular XAI methods generate. These \\textit{adversarial} examples, thus threw off the interpretable saliency maps generated by popular methods such as DeepLIFT and Integrated Gradients. This is illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:advfeatimp}. Additionally, in , Wang et al. showed that bias term which is often ignored could have high correlations towards attributions.\nIn , Kindermans et al. explained that explanations of networks are easily manipulable by simple transformations. Authors note that expressiveness of Integrated Gradients  and Deep Taylor Decomposition  highly depend on the reference point, for example a baseline image \\bm{$x^{'}$}, and suggest that the reference point should be a hyperparameter instead of being determined \\textit{a priori}. Authors mentioned that most gradient-based methods attribute incorrectly to constant vector transformations and that input invariances should be a prerequisite for reliable attributions.\nIn , Adebayo et al. suggested that gradient-based methods are inherently dependent on the model and data generating process. Authors proposed two randomization tests for gradient methods namely model parameter randomization test and data randomization test. Model parameter randomization test compared the output of saliency method for a trained model versus the same model with random weights. Data randomization test applied the same saliency method for an input instance and the same instance with a set of invariances. Authors found that Gradients and GradCAM passed the sanity checks while Guided Backprop and Guided GradCAM methods failed the tests suggesting that these methods will generate some explanations even without proper training.\nNewer methods proposed in literature such as explaining with Concepts  which we discussed in subsection \\ref{subsec:tcav} could be viewed as a new class of meta-explanations which improve both perturbation- and gradient-based XAI methods. By exploring explanations as concepts, one could have additional meta information on the factors which contributed to individual class predictions along with traditional explanation by locally explainable algorithms. \nIn , Zhou et al. introduced Interpretable Basis Decomposition as a way of decomposing individual explanation based on different objects or scenes in the input instance. By decomposing the decision to several individual concept explanations, IBD could help evaluate importance of each concepts towards a particular decision.\nIn , Kindermans et al. suggested improvements to gradient-based methods and proposed PatternNet and PatternAttribution which can estimate the component of the data that caused network activations. Here, PatternNet is similar to finding gradients but is instead done using a layer-wise backprojection of the estimated signal (data feature) to the input space. PatternAttribution improves upon LRP to provide a neuron-wise attribution of input signal to the corresponding output class.", "cites": [8500, 6091, 1824, 8080, 1617, 1816, 6090, 6080, 6088], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6428571428571429, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 4.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong analytical depth by synthesizing multiple studies on XAI visualization limitations, drawing connections between human perception and algorithmic output, and identifying recurring issues such as fragility and irrelevance of explanations.
