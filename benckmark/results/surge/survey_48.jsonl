Dynamical systems are commonly described with differential equations which are equations related to one or more unknown functions and their derivatives. \n\\begin{dfn}\\label{dfn:dynamics}\nFix an integer $k \\geq 1$ and let $U$ denote an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $u: U \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^m$ and we write $\\bm{u} = (u^1, ..., u^m)$, where $x \\in U$. Then an expression of the form \n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{F}(D^k \\bm{u}(x), D^{k-1} \\bm{u}(x), ..., D\\bm{u}(x), \\bm{u}(x), x) = 0 \\label{eqn:dynamics}\n\\end{equation}\nis called a $k^{\\text{-th}}$-order system of partial differential equation (or ordinary differential equation when $n=1$), where $\\mathcal{F}: \\mathbb{R}^{mn^k}\\times \\mathbb{R}^{mn^{k-1}}\\times...\\times\\mathbb{R}^{mn}\\times \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\times U \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^m $.\n\\end{dfn}\n$\\mathcal{F}$ models the dynamics of a $n$-dimensional state $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and it can be either a linear or non-linear operator. Since most dynamics evolve over time, one of the variables of $u$ is usually the time dimension. In general, one must specify appropriate boundary and initial conditions of Equ.\\ref{eqn:dynamics} to ensure the existence of a solution. Learning dynamical systems is to search for a model $\\mathcal{F}$ that can accurately describe the behavior of the physical process insofar as we are interested. \nPhysics as a discipline has a long tradition of using first principles to describe spatiotemporal dynamics. The laws of physics have greatly improved our understanding of the physical world. Many physics laws are described by systems of highly nonlinear differential equations that have direct implications for understanding and predicting physical dynamics. However, these equations are usually too complicated to be solvable. The current paradigm of numerical methods for solution approximation is purely physics-based: known physical laws encoded in systems of coupled differential equations are solved over space and time via numerical differentiation and integration schemes . However, these methods are tremendously computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources and expertise. An alternative is seeking simplified models that are based on certain  assumptions and roughly can describe the dynamics, such as Reynolds-averaged Navier-stokes equations for turbulent flows and Euler equations for gas dynamics . But it is highly nontrivial to obtain a simplified model that can describe a phenomenon with satisfactory accuracy. More importantly, for many complex real-world  phenomena, only partial knowledge of their dynamics is known. The equations may not fully represent the true system states.\nDeep Learning (DL) provides efficient alternatives to learn high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics from massive datasets. It achieves so by directly predicting the input-output mapping and bypassing numerical integration. Recent works have shown that DL can generate realistic predictions and significantly accelerate the simulation of physical dynamics relative to numerical solvers, from turbulence modeling to weather prediction . This opens up new opportunities at the intersection of DL and physical sciences, such as molecular dynamics, epidemiology, cardiology and material science . \nDespite the tremendous progress, DL is purely data-driven by nature, which has many limitations. DL models still adhere to the fundamental rules of statistical inference. The nonlinear and chaotic nature of real-world dynamics poses significant challenges to existing DL frameworks. Without explicit constraints, DL models are prone to make physically implausible forecasts, violating the governing laws of physical systems. Additionally, DL models often struggle with generalization: models trained on one dataset cannot adapt properly to unseen scenarios with different distributions,  known as distribution shift. For dynamics learning, the distribution shift occurs not only because the dynamics are non-stationary and nonlinear, but also due to the changes in system parameters, such as external forces and boundary conditions. In a word, the current limitation of DL models for learning complex dynamics is their lack of ability to understand the system solely from data and cope with the distributional shifts that naturally occur.\nNeither DL alone nor purely physics-based approaches can be considered sufficient for learning complex dynamical systems in scientific domains. Therefore, there is a growing need for integrating traditional physics-based approaches with DL models so that we can make the best of both types of approaches. There is already a vast amount of work about physics-guided DL , but the focus on deep learning for dynamical systems is still nascent. Physics-guided DL offers a set of tools to blend these physical concepts such as differential equations and symmetry with deep neural networks. On one hand, these DL models offer great computational benefits over traditional numerical solvers. On the other hand, the physical constraints impose appropriate inductive biases on the DL models, leading to accurate simulation, scientifically valid predictions, reduced sample complexity, and guaranteed improvement in generalization to unknown environments.  \nThis survey paper aims to provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of incorporating prior physical knowledge into DL models for learning dynamical systems.

It serves as the surrogate modeling and digital twin and  provides valuable  insights into complex physical systems. Traditional physics-based simulations often rely on running numerical methods: known physical laws encoded in systems of coupled differential equations are solved over space and time via numerical differentiation and integration schemes . Although the governing equations of many physical systems are known, finding approximate solutions using numerical algorithms and computers is still prohibitively expensive. Because the discretization step size is usually confined to be very small due to stability constraints when the dynamics are complex. Moreover, the performance of numerical methods can highly depend on the initial guesses of unknown parameters .  Recently, DL has demonstrated great success in the automation, acceleration, and streamlining of highly compute-intensive workflows for science . \nDeep dynamics models can directly approximate high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics by directly forecasting the future states and bypassing numerical integration . These models are trained to make forward predictions given the historic frames as input with one or more steps of supervision and can roll out up to hundreds of steps during inference. DL models are usually faster than classic numerical solvers by orders of magnitude since DL is able to take much larger space or time steps than classical solvers .\nAnother common approach is that deep neural networks can directly approximate the solution of complex coupled differential equations via gradient-based optimization, which is the so-called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). This approach has shown success in approximating a variety of PDEs . Additionally, deep generative models, such as diffusion models and score-based generative models, have been shown effective in accurate molecule graph generation .

DL models are essentially statistical models that learn patterns from the data they are trained on. Without explicit constraints, DL models, when trained solely on data, are prone to make scientifically implausible predictions, violating the governing laws of physical systems. In many scientific applications, it is important that the predictions made by DL models are consistent with the known physical laws and constraints. For example, in fluid dynamics, a model that predicts the velocity field of a fluid must satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum. In materials science, a model that predicts the properties of a material must obey the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of quantum mechanics.\nThus, to build trustworthy predictive models for science and engineering, we need to leverage  known physical principles to guide DL models to learn the correct underlying dynamics instead of simply fitting the observed data. For instance,  improve the physical and statistical consistency of DL models by explicitly regularising the loss function with physical constraints.

Because they learn to represent the statistical patterns in the training data, rather than the underlying causal relationships. In addition, most current approaches are still trained to model a specific system and multiple systems with close distributions, making it challenging to meet the needs of the scientific domain with heterogeneous environments. Thus, it is imperative to develop generalizable DL models that can learn and generalize well across systems with various parameter domains.\nPrior physical knowledge can be considered as an inductive bias that can place a prior distribution on the model class and shrink the model parameter search space. With the guide of inductive bias, DL models can better capture the underlying dynamics from the data that are consistent with physical laws. Across different data domains and systems, the laws of physics stay constant. Hence, integrating physical laws in DL enables the models to generalize  outside of the training domain and even to different systems. \nEmbedding symmetries into DL models is one way to improve the generalization, which we will discuss in detail in subsection \\ref{sec:symmetry}. For example,  designed deep equivariant dynamics models that respect the rotation, scaling, and uniform motion symmetries in fluid dynamics. The models are both theoretically and experimentally robust to distributional shifts by symmetry group transformations and enjoy favorable sample complexity compared with data augmentation.\nThere are many other ways to improve the generalization of DL models by incorporating other physical knowledge. \n proposed a meta-learning framework to forecast systems with different parameters.

The discovery of governing equations is crucial as it enables us to comprehend the underlying physical laws that regulate complex systems. By identifying the mathematical models that describe the behavior of a system, we can make accurate predictions and gain insights into how the system will behave under different conditions. This knowledge can be applied to optimize the performance of engineering systems, improve the precision of weather forecasts, and understand the mechanisms behind biological processes, among other applications . However, discovering governing equations is a challenging task for various reasons. Firstly, real-world systems are frequently complex and involve many interdependent variables, making it difficult to identify the relevant variables and their relationships. Secondly, many systems are nonlinear and involve interactions between variables that are hard to model using linear equations. Thirdly, the available data may be noisy or incomplete, making it challenging to extract meaningful patterns and relationships. Despite these challenges, recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to automate the process of governing equations discovery and identify complex, nonlinear models from data. These approaches may lead to new discoveries and insights into the behavior of complex systems for a wide range of applications.\nDiscovering governing equations from data is often accomplished by defining a large set of possible mathematical basis functions and learning the coefficients.  proposed to find ordinary differential equations by creating a dictionary of possible basis functions and discovering sparse, low-dimensional, and nonlinear models from data using the sparse identification. More recent work, such as , incorporated neural networks to further augment the dictionary to model more complex dynamics.   contributed to this trend by introducing an efficient first-order conditional gradient algorithm for solving the optimization problem of finding the best sparse fit to observational data in a large library of potential nonlinear models. Alternatively,  presented a shallow neural network approach, \\textit{EQL} to identify concise equations from data. They replaced the activation functions with predefined basis functions, including identity and trigonometry functions, and used specially designed division units to model division relationships in the potential governing equations. Similarly,  designed \\textit{PDE-Nets} that use convolution to approximate differential operators and symbolic neural networks to approximate and recover multivariate functions.

As shown in Figure \\ref{fig:tfnet}, it applies scale separation to model different ranges of scales of the turbulent flow individually. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are at the core of present-day turbulence simulation. Direct Numerical simulations (DNS) are accurate\nbut not computationally feasible for practical applications. Great emphasis was placed on the alternative approaches including Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes\n(RANS). Both resort to resolving large scales while modeling small scales, using various averaging techniques and/or low-pass filtering of the governing equations .\nOne of the widely used CFD techniques, the RANS-LES coupling approach ,  combines both Reynolds-averaged Equations (RANs) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approaches in order to take advantage of both methods. Inspired by RANS-LES coupling, \\textit{TF-Net} replaces a priori spectral filters with trainable convolutional layers. The turbulent flow is decomposed into three components, each of which is approximated by a specialized U-net to preserve the multiscale properties of the flow. A shared decoder learns the interactions among these three components and generates the final prediction. The motivation for this design is to explicitly guide the ML model to learn the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale and Subgrid-Scale Modeling motions as relevant to the task of spatiotemporal prediction. In other words, we need to force the model to learn not only the large eddies but also the small ones. When we train a predictive model directly on the data with MSE loss, the model may overlook the small eddies and only focus on large eddies to achieve reasonably good accuracy.\nBesides RMSE, physically relevant metrics including divergence and energy spectrum are used to evaluate the performance of the model's prediction. Figure \\ref{results} shows \\textit{TF-Net} consistently outperforms all baselines on physically relevant metrics (Divergence and Energy Spectrum). Constraining it with the divergence-free regularizer that we described in the previous section can further reduce the Divergence. Figure \\ref{rbc_pred} shows the ground truth and predicted velocity along $x$ direction by \\textit{TF-Net} and three best baselines. We see that the predictions by our TF-Net model are the closest to the target based on the shape and frequency of the motions. \nWe also perform an ablation study to understand each component of TF-Net and investigate whether the model has actually learned the flow with different scales. Figure \\ref{results} right includes  predictions and the outputs of each small U-net while the other two encoders are zeroed out. We observe that the outputs of each small U-net are the flow with different scales, which demonstrates that can learn multi-scale behaviors.

Koopman theory  provides a way to represent a nonlinear dynamical system using an infinite-dimensional linear Koopman operator that acts on a Hilbert space of measurement functions of the system state. However, finding the appropriate measurement functions that map the dynamics to the function space, as well as an approximate and finite-dimensional Koopman operator, is highly nontrivial. One way to obtain an approximation of the Koopman operator is through the Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm , but this requires manually preparing nonlinear observables, which is not always feasible as prior knowledge about them may be lacking.\nTo address this challenge, recent research has explored using neural networks to learn the Koopman operator. One popular approach hypothesizes that there exists a data transformation that can be learned by neural networks, which yields an approximate finite-dimensional Koopman operator. For example,  and  have proposed using fully connected neural networks to directly map the observed dynamics to a dictionary of nonlinear observables that span a Koopman invariant subspace.

They changed the traditionally discretized neuron layer depths into continuous equivalents such that the derivative of the hidden state can be parameterized using a neural network. The output of the network is then computed using a black box differential equation solver, making \\textit{Neural ODEs} an efficient combination of neural nets and numerical solvers.\nMore specifically, they parametrize the velocity $\\bm{\\hat{z}}$ of a hidden state $\\bm{z}$ with the\nhelp of a neural network  $\\bm{\\hat{z}} = f_{\\theta}(\\bm{z}, t)$. Given the initial time $t_0$ and target time $t_T$, \\textit{Neural ODEs} predict the target state $\\bm{\\hat{y}}_T$ by performing the following encoding, integration, and decoding operations:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\bm{z}(t_0) = \\phi_{\\text{enc}}(\\bm{y}_0), \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\bm{z}(t_T) = \\bm{z}(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^{t_T} f_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{z}, t) dt, \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\bm{\\hat{y}}_T= \\psi_{\\text{dec}}(\\bm{z}(t_T))\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the encoder $\\phi_{\\text{enc}}$ and the decoder $\\psi_{\\text{dec}}$ can be neural networks.

However, all of these are computationally intensive since they require backpropagating through the operations of the solvers and store any intermediate quantities of the forward pass, incurring a high memory cost. Thus, the adjoint method  is used to efficiently compute gradients during backpropagation. To compute the gradients of a loss function $L$ with respect to the initial state $\\bm{z}(t_0)$ and the parameters $\\bm{\\theta}$, the key idea of the adjoint method is to introduce an adjoint state $\\bm{p}(t)$, $\\bm{p}(t) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\bm{z}(t)}$, which satisfies the following differential equation:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d\\bm{p}(t)}{dt} = -\\bm{p}(t)^T \\frac{\\partial f_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{z}(t), t)}{\\partial \\bm{z}} \\label{adjoint_1}\n\\end{equation}\nThe adjoint state is used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the initial state and the parameters using the following formulas:\n\\begin{equation}\n \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\bm{\\theta}} =  - \\int_{t_T}^{t_0}\\bm{p}(t)^T  \\frac{\\partial f_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{z}(t), t)}{\\partial \\bm{\\theta}} dt; \\label{adjoint_2}\n\\end{equation}\nIn a word, these formulas can be computed efficiently by solving the ODE for $\\bm{p}(t)$ using the same numerical method used to solve the forward ODE.

During the backward pass, the adjoint state $\\bm{p}(t)$ is computed by solving Eqn. \\ref{adjoint_1} that starts from the final time $t_T$ and backpropagates through time.

Convolutional neural networks enabled breakthroughs in computer vision by leveraging translation equivariance . Similarly, recurrent neural networks , graph neural networks , and capsule networks  all impose symmetries.\nWhile the equivariant DL models have achieved remarkable success in image and text data , the study of equivariant nets in learning dynamical systems has become increasingly popular recently . Since the symmetries can be integrated into neural nets through not only loss functions but also the design of neural net layers and there has been a large volume of works about equivariant and invariant DL models for physical dynamics, we discuss this topic separately in this section. \n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width= 0.4\\textwidth,trim={55 130 55 0}]{Figures/equiv.png} \n\\caption{Illustration of equivariance: $f(x)=2x$ w.r.t $T = \\mathrm{rot}(\\pi/4)$}\n\\label{fig:equi}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\nIn physics, there is a deep connection between symmetries and physics. Noether’s law gives a correspondence between conserved quantities and groups of symmetries. For instance, translation symmetry corresponds to the conservation of energy and rotation symmetry corresponds to the conservation of angular momentum. By building a neural network that inherently respects a given symmetry, we thus make conservation of the associated quantity more likely and consequently the model’s prediction more physically accurate. Furthermore, by designing a model that is inherently equivariant to transformations of its inputs, we can guarantee that our model generalizes automatically across these transformations, making it robust to distributional shifts. \nA \\textbf{group of symmetries} or simply \\textbf{group} consists of a set $G$ together with an associative composition map $\\circ \\colon G \\times G \\to G$.  The composition map has an identity $1 \\in G$ and composition with any element of $G$ is required to be invertible. A group $G$ has an \\textbf{action} on a set $S$ if there is an action map $\\cdot \\colon G \\times S \\to S$ which is compatible with the composition law.  We say further that $\\rho : G \\mapsto GL(V)$ is a \\textbf{$G$-representation} if the set $V$ is a vector space and each group element $g \\in G$ is represented by a linear map (matrix) $\\rho(g)$ that acts on $V$.

Denote the set of solutions $\\mathrm{Sol}(\\mathcal{D}) \\subseteq \\hat{\\mathcal{F}}_V.$ We say $G$ is \\textbf{a symmetry group of $\\mathcal{D}$} if $G$ preserves $\\mathrm{Sol}(\\mathcal{D})$. That is, if $\\varphi$ is a solution of $\\mathcal{D}$, then for all $g \\in G$, $g(\\varphi)$ is also. \nIn order to forecast the evolution of a system $\\mathcal{D}$, we model the forward prediction function $f$. Let $\\bm{w} \\in \\mathrm{Sol}(\\mathcal{D})$.  The input to $f$ is a collection of $k$ snapshots at times $t - k,\\ldots,t-1$ denoted $\\bm{w}_{t-i} \\in  \\mathcal{F}_d$.  The prediction function $f\\colon \\mathcal{F}_d^k \\to \\mathcal{F}_d$ is defined $f(\\bm{w}_{t-k},\\ldots,\\bm{w}_{t-1}) = \\bm{w}_{t}$.  It predicts the solution at a time $t$ based on the solution in the past. \nLet $G$ be a symmetry group of $\\mathcal{D}$.  Then for $g \\in G$, $g(\\bm{w})$ is also a solution of $\\mathcal{D}$.  Thus  $f(g\\bm{w}_{t-k},\\ldots,g\\bm{w}_{t-1}) = g\\bm{w}_{t}$.  Consequently, $f$ is $G$-equivariant.\nThey tailored different methods for incorporating each symmetry into CNNs for spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting. CNNs are time translation-equivariant when used in an autoregressive manner. Convolutions are also naturally space translation equivariant. Scale equivariance in dynamics is unique as the physical law dictates the scaling of magnitude, space and time simultaneously. To achieve this, they replaced the standard convolution layers with group correlation layers over the group $G=(\\mathbb{R}_{>0},\\cdot)\\ltimes(\\mathbb{R}^2,+)$ of both scaling and translations. The $G$-correlation upgrades this operation by both translating \\textit{and} scaling the kernel relative to the input, \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:groupcorr}\n \\bm{v}(\\bm{p}, s, \\mu) = \\sum_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}, t \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\bm{q} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 } \\mu   \\bm{w}(\\bm{p} + \\mu \\bm{q}, \\mu^2 t,    \\lambda ) K(\\bm{q},s,t,\\lambda),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $s$ and $t$ denote the indices of output and input channels. They add an axis to the tensors corresponding to the scale factor $\\mu$. In addition, the rotational symmetry was modeled using $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$-equivariant convolutions and activations within the \\texttt{E(2)-CNN} framework .\nTo make CNNs equivariant to Galilean transformation, since they are already translation-equivariant, it is only necessary to make them equivariant to uniform motion transformation, which is adding a constant vector field to the vector field. This is part of Galilean invariance and relevant to all non-relativistic physics modeling. And the uniform motion equivariance is enforced by conjugating the model with shifted input distribution. Basically, for each sliding local block in each convolutional layer, they shift the mean of the input tensor to zero and shift the output back after convolution and activation function per sample. In other words,  if the input is $\\bm{\\mathcal{P}}_{b \\times d_{in} \\times s\\times s} $ and the output is $\\bm{\\mathcal{Q}}_{b \\times d_{out}} = \\sigma(\\bm{\\mathcal{P}} \\cdot K)$ for one sliding local block, where $b$ is batch size, $d$ is number of channels, $s$ is the kernel size, and $K$ is the kernel, then\n\\begin{align}\n\\bm{\\mu}_i = \\mathrm{Mean}_{jkl} \\left(\\bm{\\mathcal{P}}_{ijkl}\\right); \\quad\n\\bm{\\mathcal{P}}_{ijkl}\\mapsto \\bm{\\mathcal{P}}_{ijkl} - \\bm{\\mu}_i; \\quad\n\\bm{\\mathcal{Q}}_{ij} \\mapsto \\bm{\\mathcal{Q}}_{ij} + \\bm{\\mu}_i.\n\\end{align}\nThis will allow the convolution layer to be equivariant with respect to uniform motion. If the input is a vector field, this operation is applied to each element.\nThe DL models used are \\textit{ResNet} and \\textit{U-Net}, and their equivariant counterparts. Spatiotemporal prediction is done autoregressively. Standard RMSE and an RMSE computed on the energy spectra are used to measure performance. The models are tested on Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection (RBC) and reanalysis ocean current velocity data. For RBC, the test sets have random transformations from the relevant symmetry groups applied to each sample. This mimics real-world data in which each sample has an unknown reference frame. For ocean data, tests are also performed on different time ranges and different domains from the training set, representing distributional shifts. Figure \\ref{vel_u} shows the equivariant models perform significantly better than their non-equivariant counterparts on both simulated RBC data and real-world reanalysis ocean currents. They also show equivariant models also achieve much lower energy spectrum errors and enjoy favorable sample complexity compared with data augmentation. \n\\begin{figure*}[htb!]\n  \\begin{minipage}[b]{0.241\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Figures/um-resnet.png}\n  \\end{minipage} \\hfill\n  \\begin{minipage}[b]{0.241\\textwidth}\n     \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Figures/mag-resnet.png}\n  \\end{minipage} \\hfill\n  \\begin{minipage}[b]{0.241\\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Figures/rot-resnet.png}\n  \\end{minipage} \\hfill\n  \\begin{minipage}[b]{0.241\\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Figures/scale-resnet.png}\n  \\end{minipage} \n    \\begin{minipage}[b]{\\textwidth}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Figures/pred_resnet2.png}\n  \\end{minipage} \n\\caption{Top: The ground truth and the predicted velocity norm fields $\\|\\bm{w}\\|_2$ of RBC at time step $1$, $5$ and $10$ by the \\texttt{ResNet} and four \\texttt{Equ-ResNets} on four test samples applied with random uniform motion, magnitude, rotation, and scaling transformations respectively.

The key idea is relaxing the weight-sharing schemes by introducing additional trainable weights that can vary across group elements to break the strict equivariance constraints. The proposed approximate equivariant networks can always learn the correct amount of symmetry from the data, and thus consistently perform well on real-world turbulence data with no symmetry, approximate symmetry, and perfect symmetry.  When we incorporate prior knowledge into neural nets, we usually need to choose between strictly enforcing it in the design of the model or softly constraining it via regularizers. But this approach allows the model to decide whether and how to use prior knowledge (symmetry) based on the specific task. Moreover,  built a meta-learning framework, DyAd, to forecast systems with different parameters. Specifically, it utilized an encoder capable of extracting the time-invariant and translation-invariant parts of a dynamical system and a prediction network to adapt and forecast giving the inferred system.

In contrast, data augmentation techniques cannot provide equivariance guarantees when the models are applied to new datasets. Empirically and theoretically, it has been shown that equivariant and invariant neural nets offer superior data and parameter efficiency compared to data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, incorporating symmetries enhances the physical consistency of neural nets because of Noether's Law.\nHowever, incorporating too many symmetries may overly constrain the representation power of neural nets and slow down both training and inference. In addition, many real-world dynamics do not have perfect symmetries. A perfectly equivariant model that respects a given symmetry may have trouble learning partial or approximated symmetries in real-world data. Thus, an ideal model for real-world dynamics should be approximately equivariant and automatically learn the correct amount of symmetry in the data, such as the paper we discussed in Section \\ref{fluid_sym}. There are a few other works that explore the same idea. For instance,  proposed the soft equivariant layer by directly summing up a flexible layer with one that has strong equivariance inductive biases to model the soft equivariance.", "cites": [6408], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 1, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of invariant and equivariant DL models, synthesizing the concept with a cited paper on soft equivariance.

One current limitation of deep learning models for learning complex dynamics is their inability to understand the system solely from data and handle distributional shifts that naturally occur. Most deep learning models for dynamics modeling are trained to model a specific system and still struggle with generalization. For example, in turbulence modeling, deep learning models trained with fixed boundaries and initial conditions often fail to generalize to fluid flows with different characteristics. To overcome this limitation, one approach is to build physics-guided deep learning models, where the physics part plays a dominant role while the neural networks focus on learning the unknown process . Another promising direction is meta-learning. For instance,  proposed a model-based meta-learning method called \\textit{DyAd} that can generalize across heterogeneous domains of fluid dynamics. However, this model can only generalize well on the dynamics with interpolated physical parameters and cannot extrapolate beyond the range of the physical parameters in the training set. Another idea is to transform data into a canonical distribution that neural networks can learn from and then restore the original data after predictions are made . Since neural networks struggle with multiple distributions, this approach aims to find a single distribution that can represent the dynamics effectively. A trustworthy and reliable model for learning physical dynamics should be able to extrapolate to systems with various parameters, external forces, or boundary conditions while maintaining high accuracy. Therefore, further research into generalizable physics-guided deep learning is crucial.", "cites": [6365, 6394], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 2, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section discusses generalization challenges in deep learning for dynamical systems and introduces physics-guided and meta-learning approaches to address them, drawing from the cited works.

To address this issue, the field of geometric deep learning   has emerged. Geometric deep learning aims to generalize neural network models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and manifolds. However, most of the existing work in this field has been limited to static graph data. Thus, learning dynamics in non-Euclidean Ssaces is a promising direction, and geometric concepts, such as rent notions of distance, curvature, and parallel transport, must be taken into account when designing models.

On the basis of this,   took the first step to derive generalization bounds for equivariant models and data augmentation in the dynamics forecasting setting.
