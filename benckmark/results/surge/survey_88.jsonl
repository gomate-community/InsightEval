One class of classical community detection methods mainly deal only with the {\\it structure} of social networks (i.e. with connections between social actors) and ignore actors' features. There exist a variety of such structure-aware methods that have shown their efficiency in multiple applications (see ). However, the majority of real-world social networks provide more information about social actors than just connections between them. Indeed, it is rather common that certain actors' {\\it attributes} such as age, gender, interests, etc., are available. When it is so, the social network is called {\\it node-attributed} (recall that the actors are represented via nodes). According to , attributes form the second dimension, besides the structural one, in social network representation. There is another class of classical community detection methods (being opposite to the structure-aware ones, in a sense) that use only node attributes to detect communities and completely ignore connections between social actors. A representative of the attributes-aware methods is well-known $k$-means clustering algorithm taking attribute vectors as an input. Clearly, methods that deal only with structure or only with attributes do not use all the information available in a node-attributed social network. Naturally, this issue can be overcome if a method would somehow jointly use structure and attributes while detecting communities. Developing of such methods became a novel field  in social network analysis . The field is moreover promising as the joint usage is believed to clarify and enrich the knowledge about social actors and to describe the powers that form their communities . \nDuring the last decade numerous methods based on different ideas and techniques have appeared in the field. Although there exist some partial overviews of them, especially in Related Works sections of published papers and in the survey  published in 2015, a recent summary of the subject is a necessity as the growing number of the methods may cause repetitions in methodology and uncertainty in practice. \nIn this survey, we aim at describing and clarifying the overall situation in the field. Namely, we perform an exhaustive search of existing community detection methods for node-attributed social networks. What is more, we propose a classification of them based on when and how they use and fuse network structure and attributes. We not only give a description of each class but also provide general technical ideas behind each method in the class. Furthermore, we pay attention to available information which methods outperform others and which datasets and quality measures are used for their performance evaluation. Basing on the information collected, we make conclusions on the current state of the field and disclose several problems that seem important to be resolved in future. \nTo be more precise, let us describe the content of the survey.  In Section~\\ref{section2}, we first provide the reader with the notation used in the survey and state the problem of community detection in node-attributed social networks. We further briefly discuss the traditional argumentation in support of such a community detection and the effect of fusing network structure and attributes. In\nSection~\\ref{section3}, we give information about the related survey works and explain how the search of relevant literature was organized in our case. We also indicate which methods are included in the survey and which are not. Additionally, we explain why references throughout the survey are made in a certain way. Section~\\ref{section4} introduces the classification that we propose for community detection methods under consideration. In Section~\\ref{section5}, we discuss the most popular datasets and quality measures for evaluation of community detection results. This section is also helpful for simplifying exposition in the forthcoming sections. Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8} contain descriptions of the classes of methods and their representatives. In Section~\\ref{section9}, we analyze the overall situation in the field basing on the information from Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8}. Among other things, we disclose several methodological problems that are important to resolve in future studies, in our opinion. Our conclusions on the topic are summarized in Section~\\ref{section10}.", "cites": [8481, 1710], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key concepts from the cited papers by integrating structure-aware and attribute-aware methods into a coherent narrative about the importance of combining both aspects in community detection.

The effect of fusing  structure and attributes"]], "content": "\\label{subsection-str-closeness-attr-homo}\nThe structural closeness requirement is based on the recent concepts of a (structural) community in a social network. For example, communities are thought in  as subsets of nodes with dense connections within the subsets and sparse in between. In its turn,  adopts the intuition that nodes within the same community should be better connected than they would be by chance. A possible measure for that is famous Newman's Modularity  that has become an influential tool for structure-based community detection in social networks . Multiple Modularity modifications and other measures have been also proposed to assess structural closeness . In fact, the precise meaning of structural closeness in each community detection method is  determined by the measure chosen.\nThe attribute homogeneity requirement is based on the social science founding (see e.g. ) that actors' features  can reflect and affect community structure in social networks. The well-known principle of homophily in social networks states that like-minded social actors have a higher likelihood to be connected . Thus community detection process taking into account  attribute homogeneity may provide results of better quality . Oppositely to the situation with structural closeness measures, the attribute homogeneity is usually measured by Entropy that quantifies the degree of disorder of attribute vectors in $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{A})$ within the communities detected.\nLet us now discuss different points of view on the effect of fusing structure and attributes.\nFrom one side, multiple experiments, e.g. in  and many other papers cited in this survey, suggest that the structure and the attributes of a node-attributed social network often provide complementary information that improves community detection quality. For example, attributes may compensate the structural sparseness of a real-world social network , while structural information may be helpful in resolving the problem of missing or noisy attributes . What is more, it is observed in  that structure-only or attributes-only community detection is often not as effective as when both sources of information are used. From the other side, some experiments (see e.g. ) suggest that this is not always true, and network structure and attributes may be orthogonal and contradictory thus leading to ambiguous community detection results. Moreover, relations between these sources of information may be highly non-linear and challenging to analyze . \nBesides the above-mentioned points, our general impression is that there is no widely accepted opinion on the effect of fusing structure and attributes and how this fusion can influence community detection quality. Let us illustrate this with an example.\nSuppose that the structure of a certain node-attributed social network is ideally correlated with a half of attributes and is wholly orthogonal to another half. For simplicity, let the dimension of attribute vectors be small so that there is no sense to fight against the curse of dimensionality. Now we follow the popular suggestion that the mismatch between structure and  attributes negatively affects community detection quality  and that the existence of structure-attributes correlation offers ``a unique opportunity to improve the learning performance of various graph mining tasks'' . The choice is clear then: we need to use the structure and only the ideally correlated attributes for community detection. It turns out however that  we are going to use two sources of information that mostly duplicate each other. Why should we expect that this improves the quality of detected communities? From our side, we would presume that the structure and the chosen half of attributes (considered separately or jointly) would yield very similar or even the same communities, with all the ensuing consequences for assessing their quality. Shouldn't we use just one of the sources then? Furthermore, it is not clear to us why the other half of attributes should be omitted. Generally speaking, they may contain valuable information for community detection and thus omitting them because of the lack of correlation with the structure is rather questionable.\nIn any case, a focused theoretical study of when the fusion of structure and attributes is worthy and when not for community detection (ideally, in terms of subclasses of node-attributed social networks) seems to be an extremely important thing that would allow to remove the above-mentioned contradictions.", "cites": [8483, 1712, 1710, 8482, 1711, 8484, 217, 9116], "cite_extract_rate": 0.36363636363636365, "origin_cites_number": 22, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.5, "critical": 4.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple cited papers to present a coherent narrative on the fusion of structure and attributes in community detection. It critically examines the assumptions and limitations of existing approaches, such as the reliance on modularity and entropy, and challenges the notion that structure-attribute correlation is always beneficial. The abstraction is strong, as it generalizes the discussion to broader theoretical and methodological implications, proposing the need for a principled understanding of when fusion is useful."}}

At the same time, the survey \t seems to be the only one on community detection in node-attributed social networks.

Furthermore, a big amount of the methods that had been proposed before 2015 are not covered by , in particular, some based on objective function modification, non-negative matrix factorization, probabilistic models, clustering ensembles, etc. In a sense, the technique-based classification of methods in  is also sometimes confusing. For example, CODICIL , a method based on assigning attribute-aware weights on graph edges, is not included in \\cite[Section 3.2. Weight modification according to node attributes]{Bothorel2015}, but to \\cite[Section 3.7. Other methods]{Bothorel2015}. Although   is a well-written and highly cited paper, a recent  survey of community detection methods for node-attributed social networks is clearly required.\nBesides , almost every paper on the topic contains a Related Works section.

There are two possible options for this depending on the  network dataset under consideration. If the network dataset has no ground truth, one can use various measures of structural closeness and attribute homogeneity.

Many others such as Conductance, Permanence, Intra- and Inter-Cluster Densities, etc., are also possible. If there is ground truth, it is traditional to compare the detected communities with the ground truth ones. This can be done, for instance, with the following popular measures: Accuracy, Normalized Mutual Information (denoted below by NMI), Adjusted Rand Index or Rand Index (denoted below by ARI and RI, correspondingly) and $F$-measure. We will discuss both the approaches further in Section~\\ref{section9}.  \nDue to space limitations, we refer the reader to the comprehensive survey  and to \\cite[Sections 2.2 and 4]{Bothorel2015}, where all the above-mentioned quality measures and many others are precisely defined and discussed in detail.", "cites": [1711], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 1, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a basic overview of quality measures for community detection in node-attributed networks, mentioning both structure-based and attribute-based metrics.

Edge weights of $G_W$ are usually assigned as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{main_weight}\nW_\\alpha(v_i,v_j)=\\alpha w_S(v_i,v_j)+(1-\\alpha) w_A (v_i,v_j),\\qquad \\alpha\\in[0,1],\\qquad v_i,v_j\\in \\mathcal{V},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $w_S$ and $w_A$ are chosen {\\it structural} and  {\\it attributive}  similarity functions, respectively. The hyperparameter $\\alpha$ controls the balance between structure and attributes. Clearly,  if $\\alpha=1$ in (\\ref{main_weight}), one obtains weights based only on  structure; if $\\alpha=0$, then they are based only on  attributes. As for $w_S$ and $w_A$, $w_S(v_i,v_j)$ usually reflects existing connections in $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ (e.g. $w_S(v_i,v_j)=1$, if $e_{ij}\\in \\mathcal{E}$, and $w_S(v_i,v_j)=0$, otherwise),  while $w_A(v_i,v_j)$ may be Cosine Similarity or Matching Coefficient values for vectors $A(v_i)$ and $A(v_j)$.\nOnce the weighted graph $G_W$ is constructed, one can use classical graph clustering algorithms on it such as Weighted  Louvain . Sometimes $G_W$ is instead converted to a certain distance matrix that is further used for detecting communities via distance-based clustering algorithms such as  $k$-means or $k$-medoids.\nIt is worth mentioning that the fixed topology methods in this subclass assume that  the weights (\\ref{main_weight}) are assigned on the same set of edges $\\mathcal{E}$ as in the initial node-attributed graph $G$, while the non-fixed topology ones assign weights on all (or on the most part of) possible edges between nodes in $\\mathcal{V}$.\nNow let us say some words how the hyperparameter $\\alpha$ can be chosen. A very popular approach in fixed topology methods is assuming $\\alpha=0$ in (\\ref{main_weight}), see Table~\\ref{tab_weights_alpha0}. This actually means that weights in $G_W$ are based only on attributive similarity. Clearly, this may lead to dominance of  attributes in the resulting fusion and disappearance of structural connections between nodes with dissimilar attributes. Varying $\\alpha$ over the segment $[0,1]$ in (\\ref{main_weight}), used by the methods in Table~\\ref{tab_weights}, seems more adequate for controlling the impact of both the components. However, tuning $\\alpha$ in this case is usually performed {\\it manually}. In fact, we are unaware of any general non-manual approaches for tuning $\\alpha$ in (\\ref{main_weight}), although the need for such approaches has been repeatedly emphasized .\nNote that the choice of similarity functions $w_S$ and $w_A$ is usually determined by preferences of the authors of a particular method. The systematic study of how such a choice influences the community detection results is yet to be done.\n\\begin{table}\n\t\\caption{Weight-based methods with $\\alpha=0$ in

In opposite, distance-based methods intentionally abandon graph representation in favor of the representation via a distance matrix that contains information about structure and attributes. The distance matrix is usually obtained by fusing  the components by a structure- and attributes-aware distance function, see Figure~\\ref{fig:distance}. The matrix can be further fed to distance-based clustering algorithms such as $k$-means and $k$-medoids. Note that the resulting clusters may contain disconnected portions of  initial graph $G$ as the graph structure is removed at the fusion step \\cite[Section 3.3]{Akbas2017}.\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{distance.pdf}\n\t\\caption{A typical scheme of a distance-based method.}\n\t\\label{fig:distance}\n\\end{figure}\nThe distance function fusing  structure and attributes is often of the form\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{distance_main}\nD_{\\alpha}(v_i,v_j)=\\alpha d_S(v_i,v_j)+(1-\\alpha)d_A(v_i,v_j),\\qquad \\alpha\\in[0,1],\\qquad v_i,v_j\\in \\mathcal{V},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $d_S$ and $d_A$ are {\\it structural} and {\\it attributive} distance functions, correspondingly. As in the case of (\\ref{main_weight}), $\\alpha$ in (\\ref{distance_main}) controls the balance between the components; how to choose it ``properly'' seems to be an open problem, too. As for the distance functions, it is common to define $d_S(v_i,v_j)$ as the shortest path length between $v_i$ and $v_j$. Possible options for $d_S(v_i,v_j)$ are the Jaccard or Minkowski distances between vectors $A(v_i)$ and $A(v_j)$.\nShort descriptions for known distance-based methods are given in Table~\\ref{tab:distance}.

As mentioned in , graph algorithms suffer from high computational complexity, low parallelisability and inapplicability of machine learning methods. Novel embedding techniques aim at tackling this by learning {\\it node embeddings}, i.e. low-dimensional continuous vector representations for network nodes so that main network information is efficiently encoded . Roughly speaking, node embedding techniques allow to convert a graph with $n$ nodes into a set of $n$ vectors.\nIn the context of node-attributed social networks, the objective of node embedding techniques is efficient encoding both structure and attributes . We are not going to provide general details on the techniques as this has been already done in the surveys . Let us just mention that having node embeddings (i.e. vectors) at hand allows one to use classical distance-based clustering algorithms such as $k$-means to detect communities, see Figure~\\ref{fig:embeddings}.\nIt turns out that there exists a rich bibliography on node embedding techniques for attributes networks of different type  .

As is well known, NNMF is able to find clusters in the input data . \nTo be applied to community detection in node-attributed social networks, NNMF requires a proper adaptation to fuse both structure and  attributes. Different versions of such an adaptation have been proposed, see Table~\\ref{tab:NMF}. \nTo be more formal in describing the corresponding NNMF-based methods, let us introduce additional notation. Let ${\\bf S}_{n\\times n}$ denote the adjacency matrix for the network structure (as before, $n$ is the number of nodes), ${\\bf A}_{n\\times d}$ the node attribute matrix for the network attributes ($d$ is the dimension of attribute vector $A$), $N$ the number of required clusters (it is an input in NNMF-based methods), ${\\bf U}_{n\\times N}$ the cluster membership matrix whose elements indicate the association of nodes with communities, and finally ${\\bf V}_{d\\times N}$ denotes the cluster membership matrix whose elements indicate the association of the attributes with the communities. In these terms, the aim of NNMF-based methods is to use known matrices  $\\bf S$, $\\bf A$ and the number of clusters $N$ in order to determine the unknown matrices $\\bf U$ and $\\bf V$ in an iterative optimization procedure.  For example, {\\bf SCI}  models structural closeness as $\\min_{{\\bf U}\\ge 0}\\|{\\bf S}-{\\bf U}{\\bf U}^T\\|^2_F$ and attribute homogeneity as \n$\\min_{{\\bf V}\\ge 0}\\|{\\bf U}-{\\bf A}{\\bf V}\\|^2_F$. It is also proposed to select the most relevant attributes for each community by adding an $l_1$ norm sparsity term to each column of matrix\n$\\bf V$. As a result, one obtains the following optimization problem: \n$$\n\\min_{{\\bf U}\\ge 0,\\,{\\bf V}\\ge 0}\\left(\\alpha_1\\|{\\bf S}-{\\bf U}{\\bf U}^T\\|^2_F+\\|{\\bf U}-{\\bf A}{\\bf V}\\|^2_F+\\alpha_2 \\sum\\nolimits_j \\|{\\bf V}(\\cdot,j)\\|^2_1\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_1>0$ controls the impact of structure and $\\alpha_1\\ge 0$ the sparsity penalty. This problem is further approximately solved in an iterative process according to Majorization-Minimization framework .\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption {Non-negative matrix factorization-based and matrix compression-based methods.} \\label{tab:NMF} \n\\begin{center}\n\t{\\tiny\n\t\t\\begin{tabular}{|p{1.6cm}|p{1.8cm}|p{1.8cm}|p{1cm}|p{2cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.8cm}|}\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\tAlgorithm & Factorization/ compression type   & Require the number of clusters/ Clusters overlap & Size of datasets used for evaluation & Quality measures &  Datasets used & Compared with \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf NPei}  & 3-factor NNMF & Yes/Yes & Small\\newline Medium & Purity  &  {\\bf Twitter} \\newline DBLP* &   Relational Topic Model \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf 3NCD}  & $2$-factor NNMF  & Yes/Yes & Medium\\newline Large & F1-score \\newline Jaccard\n\t\t\tsimilarity &   {\\bf ego-Facebook}\\newline {\\bf ego-Twitter}\\newline {\\bf ego-G+} &  {\\bf CESNA}  \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf SCI}  & 2-factor NNMF  & Yes/Yes & Medium & ACC \\newline NMI \\newline GNMI \\newline $F$-measure \\newline Jaccard similarity  &   {\\bf Citeseer}\\newline {\\bf Cora}\\newline {\\bf WebKB}\\newline {\\bf LastFM} &   {\\bf PCL-DC} \\newline {\\bf CESNA} \\newline {\\bf DCM} \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf JWNMF}  & 2-factor NNMF &  Yes/Yes & Small\\newline Medium & Modularity\\newline Entropy\\newline NMI  &   Amazon Fail \\href{https://www.ipd.kit.edu/mitarbeiter/muellere/consub/}{dataset} \n\t\t\t\\newline Disney \\href{http://www.perozzi.net/projects/focused-clustering/}{dataset} \\newline Enron \\href{https://www.ipd.kit.edu/mitarbeiter/muellere/consub/}{dataset} \\newline DBLP-4AREA \\href{http://www.perozzi.net/projects/focused-clustering/}{dataset}\\newline {\\bf WebKB} \\newline {\\bf Citeseer} \\newline {\\bf Cora}  &  {\\bf BAGC} \\newline {\\bf PICS} \\newline SANS \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf SCD}  & 2- and 3-factor NNMF   & Yes/Yes-No & Small\\newline Medium & Accuracy \\newline NMI  &  {\\bf Twitter}\\newline {\\bf WebKB} &  {\\bf SCI} \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\t{\\bf ASCD}  & 2-factor NNMF &Yes/Yes-No & Small\\newline Medium & ACC \\newline NMI \\newline $F$-measure \\newline Jaccard similarity  &  {\\bf LastFM} \\newline {\\bf WebKB}\\newline {\\bf Cora} \\newline {\\bf Citeseer} \\newline {\\bf ego-Twitter*} \\newline {\\bf ego-Facebook*}   &  Block-LDA \\newline {\\bf PCL-DC} \\newline {\\bf SCI} \\newline {\\bf CESNA} \\newline {\\bf Circles} \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\t{\\bf CFOND}  & $2$- and $3$-factor NMF &   Yes/(Yes/No) & Medium & Accuracy \\newline NMI &   {\\bf Cora}\\newline {\\bf CiteSeer}\\newline {\\bf PubMed}\\newline {\\bf Attack}\\newline Synthetic\n\t\t\t&  GNMF \\newline DRCC  \\newline \n\t\t\tLP-NMTF \\newline iTopicModel \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf MVCNMF}  & $2$-factor NMF & Yes/Yes & Small\\newline Medium & Density\\newline Entropy &   {\\bf Political\n\t\t\t\tBlogs}\\newline {\\bf CiteSeer}\\newline {\\bf Cora}\\newline {\\bf WebKB} \\newline ICDM (DBLP*) &  FCAN \\newline  SACTL  \\newline {\\bf kNAS} \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\t{\\bf PICS}  (\\href{http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/pubs.html#pics}{source}) & Matrix compression (finding rectangular blocks)   & No/No & Small\\newline Medium & Anecdotal and visual study &   Youtube \\newline {\\bf Twitter}* \\newline Phonecall  \\newline Device  \\newline {\\bf Political Books} (\\href{http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/}{link}) \\newline {\\bf Political Blogs} & ---\\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\\end{tabular}\n\t}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\\begin{remark}\nAn NNMF-based community detection method for {\\it multi-layer}  networks is given in .\n\\end{remark}\nNow we briefly describe {\\bf PICS} , the method adopting matrix compression\\footnote{The aim of compression methods is to find a\nshorter form of describing the same information content.} for community detection in node-attributed social networks. {\\bf PICS} uses lossless compression principles from  to simultaneously compress the network adjacency matrix $\\bf S$ and the attribute matrix $\\bf A$.

It is worth mentioning here that it is common for pattern mining-based methods to detect communities not in the whole network but in its part only (e.g. ). \n\\begin{table}\n\\caption {Pattern mining-based (simultaneous fusion) methods.}\n\\label{tab:clique} \n\\begin{center}\n\t{\\tiny\n\t\t\\begin{tabular}{|p{1.4cm}|p{1.2cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.0cm}|p{1.8cm}|}\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\tMethod & Patterns used  & Require the number of clusters/ Clusters overlap & Size of datasets used for evaluation & Quality measures &  Datasets used & Compared with\\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf DCM}  (\\href{http://www.patternsthatmatter.org/software.php}{source}) & Semantic patterns ({\\it queries})  & Yes/Yes & Small\\newline Medium & Community score\\newline Conductance \\newline Intra-cluster density \\newline Modularity &   {\\bf Delicious}\\newline {\\bf LastFM}\\newline {\\bf Flickr} &  --- \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf COMODO}  & Semantic patterns  & Yes/Yes & Small\\newline Medium & Description complexity\\newline Community size &   BibSonomy \\newline {\\bf Delicious} \\newline {\\bf LastFM} &  {\\bf DCM} \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline \n\t\t\t{\\bf ACDC}   & Maximal cliques & Yes/Yes & Medium & Density & {\\bf Political Blogs} &   {\\bf SA-Cluster} \\newline {\\bf SAC1-SAC2} \\\\\n\t\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\end{tabular}\n\t}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\\begin{remark}\nABACUS  detects  communities by extracting patterns in {\\it multi-layer} networks.\n\\end{remark}", "cites": [1714, 1710], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2222222222222222, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of pattern mining-based methods, listing a few approaches and their characteristics in a table.

Particularly, we would like to determine which methods are {\\it state-of-the-art}\\footnote{According to Cambridge Dictionary, state-of-the-art means ``the best and most modern of its type''.}. This is probably what a researcher/data scientist facing the community detection problem in node-attributed social networks expects from our survey.\nWe start with observing the directed graph based on the information in Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8} and showing method-method comparisons, see Figure~\\ref{fig:graph1}. It requires several comments though. First, there are methods in Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8} that are not compared with others for community detection in node-attributed networks or compared with a few. For this reason, we include in the graph only nodes (representing methods) whose  degree is at least two. This means that there are at least two comparison experiments with each method presented in Figure~\\ref{fig:graph1}. Note that 46 methods are shown in the graph of 75 classified in the survey. \nSecond, the directed edges in the graph show the existing method-method comparisons. For example, the directed edge from node {\\bf CESNA}  to node {\\bf CODICIL}  indicates that the authors of  {\\bf CESNA}  compared their method with {\\bf CODICIL}  and showed that {\\bf CESNA}  outperforms {\\bf CODICIL}  in some sense (community detection quality, computational efficiency, etc.). This is applied to all edges in the graph.\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\t\\label{fig:graph1}\n    \\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{Graph1new.pdf}\n\t\\caption{The directed graph of existing method-method comparisons. Nodes (shown only those with degree $\\ge 2$) represent the methods classified in the present survey. The most influential methods (nodes with highest PageRank) are filled green so that the darker green means the higher PageRank.}\n\\end{figure}\nWhat is more, we used PageRank to detect the most important or, better to say, {\\it most influential methods} in the field. Nodes with the highest PageRank values are filled green in Figure~\\ref{fig:graph1} so that the darker green means the higher PageRank. It turns out that the most influential ones are (in the order they discussed in Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8}):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item weight-based {\\bf SAC2}~ and {\\bf CODICIL}~ (Subsection~\\ref{class-ef-weight}),\n\\item node-augmented graph-based {\\bf SA-Cluster} , {\\bf Inc-Cluster}  and {\\bf SA-Cluster-Opt}~ (Subsection~\\ref{class-ef-node-augmented-graph}),\n\\item {\\bf SAC1}~ modifying the Louvain objective function   (Subsection~\\ref{class-sf-modifying}),\n\\item NNMF-based {\\bf SCI}  and matrix compression-based {\\bf PICS}  (Subsection~\\ref{class-sf-nnmf}),\n\\item pattern mining-based (simultaneous fusion) {\\bf DCM}  (Subsection~\\ref{class-sf-patterns}),\n\\item probabilistic model-based {\\bf PCL-DC} , {\\bf BAGC} , {\\bf GBAGC} , {\\bf CESNA}  and {\\bf Circles}  (Subsection~\\ref{class-sf-probabilistic-models}).\n\\end{itemize}\nIn our opinion, these methods may be though to be chosen by researchers' community as those determining further developments in the field. Thus we encourage a newcomer in the field  to get familiar with them first to see the main ideas and techniques existing for community detection in node-attributed social networks.\nAt the same time, we would not consider the most influential methods as state-of-the-art as other methods are shown to outperform them in some sense.\nWhat else the graph in Figure~\\ref{fig:graph1} can tell us about? We emphasize that it does not contain 29 methods of those discussed in  Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8} and furthermore it is rather sparse and even disconnected. These points lead to the conclusion that the comparison study of the methods in the field is far from being complete. We would even strengthen the conclusion made by saying that a researcher/data scientist cannot be sure that the method chosen for practical use is preferable to other existing ones, even if there is an edge in Figure~\\ref{fig:graph1}. The problem is that the comparison experiments (represented via the edges) are made by different means, e.g. different quality measures, datasets, hyperparameter tuning strategies, etc. Let us discuss it below in more detail.\nSuppose for a second that two methods show the same community detection quality for a number of datasets and measures, and their hyperparameters are tuned to provide the best possible results. Then we should think how much time/space each method uses for it. Particularly, we may think of method's computational complexity in terms of the number of vertices $n$, the number of edges $m$ and the attribute dimension $d$ in a node-attributed graph. Such estimates exist for certain methods, particularly for some of the most influential ones. Examples are {\\bf CODICIL}~ with $O(n^2\\log n)$, {\\bf SA-Cluster}  with $O(n^3)$ and {\\bf CESNA}  with $O(m)$. However, we could not find such estimates for the majority of methods discussed in Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8} as authors often omit such estimation. This makes the overall comparison of methods in terms of computational complexity impossible.\nNow let us discuss the hyperparameter tuning problem. It turns out that some authors tune hyperparameters in their methods manually, some just do not consider the problem at all. Another issue is the lack of a general understanding how to determine ``equal impact'' of  structure and attributes on the community detection results. For example, in the weight-based early fusion methods (Subsection~\\ref{class-ef-weight}) some authors choose $\\alpha=1/2$ in experiments hoping that this provides the equal impact. However, if ones takes into account the different nature of structural and attributive information and the disbalance between associated statistical features, this choice seems questionable in a general situation.\nFurthermore, authors use different datasets (of various size and nature, see Section~\\ref{section5}) and quality measures to test their methods so that a unified comparison of experimental results in different papers cannot be carried out\\footnote{A more general observation is that several comparison experiments clearly do not provide generality of conclusions. This however seems to be a hot topic among supporters of scientific research from one side and of empirical one from another side.}. What is more, datasets and software implementations used in comparison experiments are rarely provided by the authors (especially of out-of-date papers) thus making reproducing their results time-consuming or even impossible. Note how few links to source codes are indicated in Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8}.\nLet us now discuss the methodology of using quality measures in comparison experiments. There exist two main strategies (see Section~\\ref{section5}). Namely, community detection quality can be evaluated (a) by heuristic measures of structural closeness and attributes homogeneity (e.g. Modularity and Entropy) when the dataset under consideration has no ``ground truth'' and (b) by measures estimating the agreement between the detected communities and the ground truth ones (e.g. NMI or ARI).\nLet us first discuss Option (a) in terms of a typical weight-based early fusion method from Subsection~\\ref{class-ef-weight}. For a given node-attributed graph $G$, suppose that we first convert its attributes $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{A})$ into attributive graph $G_A$ and further fuse it with the structure $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$. This results in weighted graph $G_W$ that is thought to contain information about both the structure and the attributes in a unified form. After that, we find communities in $G_W$ that provide, say, the maximum of  Modularity of $G_W$ (e.g. by Weighted Louvain). At the evaluation step we further calculate Modularity of $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ and Entropy of $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{A})$ basing on the partition found. This seems reasonable as far as you do not look at such a methodology critically. Indeed, note that we deal with one quality measure within the optimization process (Modularity of $G_W$) but evaluate community detection performance by other measures (Modularity of $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ and Entropy of $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{A})$). Generally speaking, how can we be sure that optimization of one objective function provides optimal values of other objective functions, if there is no mathematically established connection between them? Of course, this may be simply called a heuristic but it looks more a logical gap, from our point of view. Anyways, we are unaware of any explicit explanation of such a methodology. What is more, one should carefully study how the change of data representation within a method (the change of vectors $\\mathcal{A}$ for edge weights in $G_A$ in the above-mentioned example) affects community detection results.\nTake into account that a similar discussion is suitable for the majority of methods in Sections~\\ref{section6}--\\ref{section8} that use quality measures for estimating structural closeness and attributes homogeneity of the detected communities. The exception is the methods that directly optimize the quality measures {\\it within the optimization process}. Examples are the simultaneous fusion methods {\\bf OCru} , \n{\\bf SAC1} ,\n{\\bf ILouvain} , \n{\\bf UNCut} , \n{\\bf MOEA-SA} ,\n{\\bf MOGA-@Net}  and \n{\\bf JCDC} .\nJust by construction, they aim at providing   optimal values of the quality measures. One should however take into account the precision of the optimization method applied. \nNow we turn our attention to the methodology of evaluating community detection quality by measures that estimate the agreement between the detected communities and the ground truth ones (Option (b)). In our opinion, such a methodology makes sense for synthetic node-attributed social networks as the way how the communities are formed is known in advance. As for real-world networks, it seems somewhat questionable as ground truth communities may reflect only one point of view on network communities (among many possible). Therefore, expecting that a community detection method would share this point of view seems a bit unsuitable. There are several works on this issue, e.g. , discussing connections between ground truth, attributes and quality measures in detail, and therefore we refer the interested reader to them.\nRecall that we started this discussion trying to determine the state-of-the-art methods for community detection in node-attributed social networks. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned facts do not give us a chance to do this. Of course, we could simply list the most recent methods in the field (and then it is enough to check just the time of publication), but this certainly does not meet the requirements imposed on state-of-the-art methods.", "cites": [7062, 1712, 1714, 1723, 1724, 1721], "cite_extract_rate": 0.34782608695652173, "origin_cites_number": 23, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 4.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section offers a high-level analytical overview by synthesizing multiple methodological approaches and integrating them into a structured evaluation using a directed graph and PageRank analysis.
