In various real-life applications, we need to identify highly influential or important nodes; for example, if we want to set up a service center for the public, then which location is best for this, or if we want to provide free samples of the product then to whom we should give it, or if we want to identify popular people in society then how to find them? The importance of a node changes based on the given application context. A high degree node can be influential in spreading the information in the local neighborhood, but it will not be able to make the information viral globally if it is not connected with the other influential/core nodes . Similarly, a high betweenness node will be important to spread the information across the communities, but it might not be influential locally based on its connections in the local community. Researchers have studied these phenomena and defined various centrality measures to identify important nodes based on the application requirements like degree centrality , semi-local centrality , closeness centrality , betweenness centrality , eigenvector centrality , katz centrality , PageRank , and so on.\nThese centrality measures can be categorized as local centrality measures and global centrality measures. Centrality measures that can be calculated using local information of the node are called local centrality measures like degree centrality, semi-local centrality, etc. But the computation of global centrality measures, such as closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, coreness centrality, PageRank, etc., requires the entire structure of the network. So, these centrality measures are called global centrality measures as they can not be computed without global information. These measures have high computational complexity. \nNext, we discuss the main research problems that have attracted researchers in this area.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Extensions:} \nIn 1977, Freeman proposed three main centrality measures to identify the importance of nodes based on its local and global connectivity . The proposed definitions were applicable for undirected and unweighted networks. But these unweighted networks are not enough to convey the complete information of the system. The different complex systems are represented using a variety of networks like directed networks, weighted networks, multiplex networks, and so on. These networks require redefining the centrality metrics to measure the importance of nodes. We will discuss these extensions in the current report.\n\\item \\textbf{Approximation Algorithms:} The computation of global centrality measures takes more time in large scale networks due to their high computational complexity. So, researchers have proposed approximation methods to fast compute centrality values in real-world large scale networks. \nThese approximation methods can be efficiently used to compare two nodes, where we don't need actual centrality values.\n\\item \\textbf{Update centrality values in dynamic networks:} Real-world networks are highly dynamic. It will be very costly to compute global centrality measures every time the network is updated like addition or deletion of nodes or edges. So, researchers have proposed efficient methods to update centrality values in the dynamic networks whenever there is a change in the network.\n\\item \\textbf{Identification of top-k nodes:} In many applications, we are only interested in identifying the top few nodes like identifying top-k important nodes in the Internet system to provide instant backup, selecting top-k people to provide free samples, etc. There are methods to identify top-k nodes without computing the centrality value of all nodes. \nIt reduces the overall complexity of the method.\n\\item \\textbf{Ranking of a node:} Main objective to define centrality measures is to rank nodes. There is not much work in this direction. In one of our previous works, we have proposed a method to estimate the degree rank of a node using local information. To measure the global rank of a node using local information based on other centrality measures is still an open research question.\n\\item \\textbf{Applications:} The applications of centrality measures are highly dependent on the requirements. The discussion on each centrality measure is concluded with its applications. We also discuss which centrality measure can be applied to what types of applications in the Applications section.\n\\item \\textbf{Others:} A few other related works on global centrality measures are like the computation of centrality measures in distributed networks, parallel algorithms to fast compute centrality values, correlations of different centrality measures, hybrid centrality measures, and so on. The works that study the correlation of different centrality measures include . We will discuss these in brief in section 3.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe brief categorization of research work on centrality measures is shown in Figure 1. Other research directions include the proposal of hybrid and application-specific centrality measures. These centrality measures work better for some specific types of networks.\n\\begin{figure}[]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{rank2.png}\n\\caption{Categorization of research work on Centrality Measures}\n\\end{figure}\nCentrality measures also have been defined for a group of nodes to measure how central the group is with respect to the given network. For example, the closeness centrality of a group of nodes can be computed to understand how close these nodes are in the given network. Similarly, the coreness of a group of nodes can be computed to measure how tightly knit these nodes are with each other and with the rest of the network.\nLike nodes, the complex networks also have unique characteristics. \nFew simple parameters to compare two networks are like their densities, diameters, the rate of changes, clustering coefficient, assortativity, and so on. Apart from these simple parameters, there are some other methods that can be used to compare other complex properties of the network like core-periphery profiling that shows how central the given network is . The work on centrality measures can be categorized as shown in Figure 2. In this report, our main focus is on the centrality measures defined for nodes.\n\\begin{figure}[]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=12cm]{rank1.png}\n\\caption{Categories of Centrality Measures}\n\\end{figure}\nThis report is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss preliminaries and definitions of centrality measures. Next, we discuss the state of the art on centrality measures. It is followed by the discussion on various real-world complex networks and the centrality measures that have been applied to study those networks.

In-degree centrality is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$C_{D_{in}}(u) = \\frac{k^{in}_u}{n-1}$\n\\end{center}\nwhere, $C_{D_{in}}(u)$ represents in-degree centrality of node $u$, and $k^{in}_u$ represents in-degree of node $u$.\nSimilarly, out-degree centrality can be defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$C_{D_{out}}(u) = \\frac{k_{out}(u)}{n-1}$\n\\end{center}\nwhere, $C_{D_{out}}(u)$ represents out-degree centrality of node $u$, and $k^{out}(u)$ represents out-degree of node $u$.\nIn disconnected networks, the degree centrality of a node can be computed just by taking its degree in the largest connected component to that the node belongs. For isolated nodes (having degree zero), the degree centrality is zero.\nDegree centrality also has been extended to weighted networks, where the strength of the node is used to define it. In weighted networks, the strength of a node $s_u$ denotes the sum of weights of all the edges connected to that node. It is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$s_{u} = \\sum_{v}w_{uv}$\n\\end{center}\nIn weighted networks, the degree centrality considers two important parameters: 1. strength of the node, and 2. degree of the node (total number of connections that a node has). These two parameters show two different aspects of the network. For example, in a network, if two nodes have same strength but a different number of connections, then these two nodes can not be rated equally. It is based on the requirement that more connections are preferred or fewer connections. To incorporate these both parameters, Opsahl proposed generalized degree centrality for weighted networks . It is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$C_D^{w \\alpha}(u)= k_u^{(1-\\alpha)} \\times s_u^{\\alpha}$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a tuning parameter that can be decided based on the requirement. If this parameter is between 0 and 1, then more importance is given to degree, whereas if it is set above 1, then more preference is given to the strength of the node. But still, it is difficult to determine the exact value of $\\alpha$. Wei et al. proposed a method to select the optimal value of tuning parameter $\\alpha$ . Yustiawan et al. used this centrality metric to identify influential nodes in online social networks . This metric can be further extended to directed weighted networks, where in-degree and out-degree of the node can be considered to define in-degree and out-degree centrality, respectively.\nKretschmer used the information of weighted ties to extend degree centrality . They verify the proposed method on collaboration and citation networks. Rachman et al. created a weighted network of Twitter, where the weight of the ties is based on following/follower relationship, and the number of tweet interactions such as mention, reply, and retweet . They show that the Kretschmer method can be efficiently used on Twitter network to identify influential nodes.\nDegree centrality has been used for decades to identify eimportant and influential nodes in the network. By considering the simplicity of degree centrality, many extensions have been provided to better rank nodes using the degree and some other local parameters. Chen et al. studied the correlation of the clustering coefficient and the influential power of a node. They showed that the local clustering has negative impacts on the information spreading and making new connections. They analyzed the impact of clustering and proposed a local ranking algorithm named ClusterRank that considers the number of neighbors, neighbors’ influences, and their clustering coefficient . They simulated the experiment using susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model  and showed that the clusterRank is much more efficient than other benchmark algorithms such as PageRank and LeaderRank. They also verified the proposed method on undirected networks and showed that it is more efficient than degree centrality and coreness. It runs 15 times faster than pagerank algorithm, so this can be used in real-life applications.\nYang et al. further studied the impact of triangular links on the influential power of a node and proposed a node prominence profile method that considers preferential attachment and triadic closure to determine the importance of a node . The degree centrality of a node can convey more information if the degree centrality of its neighbors is also considered. Ai et al. introduced the neighbor vector centrality metric that also considers the degree distribution of its neighbors . Their results show that it is highly efficient to measure the importance of a node, and it can be easily computed on large networks.\nIn real-life applications, sometimes, we are interested in selecting a group of nodes that is highly influential. This group can be the collection of nodes that might not be highly influential individually, but as a group, they have the highest influential power. Elbirt studied the degree centrality property of a network at the node level as well as at the group level . They further compare degree centrality across different topologies like ring lattice, small world, random network, core-periphery, scale-free, and so on.\nCsato proposed generalized degree centrality based on the idea that the connections with more interconnected nodes contribute to centrality more than the connections with less central ones . Generalized degree centrality $k'_u$ for a node $u$ is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$k_u=k'_u + \\varepsilon \\sum_{v \\epsilon V \\setminus u} a_{uv}[k'_u - k'_v]$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is a constant, and it is used to decide the importance of the neighbors. Generalized degree centrality is better to use than the degree centrality as it considers both the degree and role of the neighbors to measure a node's importance. It gives results similar to eigenvector centrality that we will discuss later.\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that degree centrality alone is not enough to give a clear picture of the importance of a node in real-world networks. In 2013 Abbasi et al. proposed hybrid centrality measures called Degree-Degree, Degree-Closeness, Degree-Betweenness by combining existing centrality measures . The Degree-Degree centrality of a node is calculated by summing up the degree of its neighbors. Similarly, Degree-Closeness and Degree-Betweenness centrality of a node is calculated just by summing up the closeness and betweenness centrality of its neighbors, respectively. They also studied the correlation and importance of the proposed centrality measures with respect to other existing centrality measures. The proposed method was verified on the co-authorship network and gave a good correlation with the ranking of scholars. They have also extended the proposed method for weighted networks.\nIn traditional degree centrality, we only consider the number of neighbors, but we do not consider the duration of the link. This information can give us more insights to better understand the position of a node in the given network. Uddien et al. proposed a time-variant approach to degree centrality measure, called TSDC (time scale degree centrality) . TSDC considers both the presence and duration of the links between nodes. They simulate the proposed approach on the doctor-patient network, where a link is established when a patient is hospitalized, and the duration of the link represents the length of the stay. If the length of the stay is smaller, TSDC can give a better explanation than traditional degree centrality. This method can be applied to real-world networks that are highly dynamic and where the strength of a link has more impact on the node.\nDegree centrality is also extended to other types of networks, such as multiplex networks , hypergraphs , and so on. Kapoor et al. extended degree centrality for hypergraphs and proposed two centrality measures called: 1. strong tie degree centrality, and 2. weak tie degree centrality . They verified their methods on two real-world networks, DBLP (computer science collaboration network) and CR3 (group network of a popular Chinese multi-player online game), and showed that the proposed methods outperform degree centrality. Brodka et al. proposed multilayered degree centrality called CLDC (cross-layer degree centrality) for multilayer social networks . They check the efficacy of their method on online real-world social networks containing ten layers. The proposed method is also extended to directed networks where the cross-layer indegree centrality $(CLDC_{In})$, and cross-layer out-degree centrality $(CLDC_{Out})$ can be defined using in-degree and out-degree centrality, respectively.", "cites": [7921, 7922, 4885], "cite_extract_rate": 0.17647058823529413, "origin_cites_number": 17, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple sources by connecting different extensions of degree centrality (e.g., directed, weighted, generalized, time-variant) into a coherent narrative.

However, while it identifies general trends (e.g., the insufficiency of degree centrality alone), it does not fully abstract to overarching principles or frameworks, staying closer to specific methods and applications."}}

The degree centrality rank of a node $u$ can be computed as, $R(u) = \\sum_{v} X_{uv} + 1$, where $X_{uv} = 1,$ if $C_D(v) > C_D(u)$, otherwise $X_{uv} = 0$. A node having the highest centrality value is ranked $1$, and all nodes having the same centrality value will have the same rank . Currently, we follow a two-step process to compute the rank, 1. compute centrality value of all the nodes, and 2. compare them to measure the rank of the node. This method requires the entire network to measure the rank of a single node. The size of real-world networks is increasing very fast, and they are highly dynamic. This motivates researchers to propose efficient methods to estimate the centrality rank of a node without computing the centrality value of all the nodes. \nSaxena et al.  proposed a method to estimate the degree rank in real-world scale-free networks, and proved that the expected degree rank of a node $u$ can be computed as, $E[R_{G}(u)] \\approx n \\left( \\frac{k_{max}^{1-\\gamma} - (k_{u}+1)^{1-\\gamma}}{ k_{max}^{1-\\gamma} - k_{min}^{1-\\gamma} } \\right)  + 1$, where $n$ denotes the network size, $k_{max}$ and $k_{min}$ denote the maximum and minimum degree in the network respectively, and $k_u$ denotes the degree of node $u$. The authors also proposed methods  to estimate degree ranking using different sampling techniques, such as uniform sampling, random walk , and metropolis-hastings random walk . The sampling methods were used to collect a small sample set of the nodes for the rank estimation, and the results showed that $1\\%$ samples are adequate to estimate the degree rank of a node with high accuracy. The proposed methods were simulated on both synthetic as well as real-world scale-free networks, and the accuracy was evaluated using absolute and weighted error functions. The proposed methods were further extended to estimate the degree rank in random networks .", "cites": [5354, 5353, 5355], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes the cited papers by highlighting a shared objective — estimating degree centrality rank without full network data — and showing how different approaches (e.g., power-law assumptions, sampling techniques) are used to achieve this.

In weighted networks, closeness centrality of a node $u$ can be defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$C_C^w(u) = \\left [\\sum_{\\forall v}d^w(u,v) \\right ]^{-1}$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $v \\epsilon V$ and $d^w(u,v)$ is the shortest weighted distance between nodes $u$ and $v$. Ruslan et al. used arithmetic mean approach and extended closeness centrality for weighted networks . The proposed centrality metric was simulated on synthetic networks. They showed that the proposed method gives better results to identify influential nodes in weighted networks.\nDu et al. proposed effective distance closeness centrality (EDCC) for directed networks that can also be applied to undirected, weighted, and unweighted networks . The effective distance was proposed by Brockmann to analyze disease spread . In EDCC, the authors used Susceptible-Infected (SI) model  to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. SI model is used to measure the influential power of a node. This model is used to simulate information flow in a given complex network. In this model, all nodes are considered uninfected in the starting. Then few nodes are infected to understand the flow of the information spread. Once a node is infected, its status is changed to infected. An infected node gets one chance to infect its neighbors in each step. When a node is infected, it can infect any of its neighbors with some fixed probability in the next iteration. Thus this model perfectly captures the exponential information flow in real-world networks. The authors used this model to rank nodes based on the information flow. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified on four real-world networks. Brandes and Fleischer proposed the idea that the information spreads like an electric current in a network as it does not spread only using the shortest paths. . They proposed a variation of closeness centrality based on that and also proposed a faster method to compute the same.\nIn a disconnected network, the basic definition of closeness centrality is not able to rank nodes properly. The traditional closeness centrality is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$C_C(u) \\propto \\left [\\sum_{v}d(u,v) \\right ]^{-1}$\n\\end{center}\nIf the graph is disconnected, then at least one term in the summation will be $\\infty$, so the summation will be $\\infty$, and the closeness centrality of all nodes will be $0$. One solution that we can use is, compute the closeness centrality of each node with respect to the connected component to which this node belongs. But it ignores a lot of other information that is present in the network.\nIn 2001, Latora et al. proposed closeness centrality for disconnected networks . It is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$C_C(u) = \\sum_{v} {\\frac{1}{d(u,v)}} $\n\\end{center}\nIn 2006, Dangalchev proposed another definition of closeness centrality that can be used for disconnected graphs . It is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$C_C(u) = \\sum_{v} {\\frac{1}{2^{d(u,v)}}} $\n\\end{center}\nThis method provides an easy way to compute closeness centrality than the traditional way. Yang et al. showed that all provided extension of closeness centrality for disconnected graphs are not true extensions . They do not rank nodes in the same way as the closeness centrality does. In 2009, Rochat proposed a harmonic centrality index that is an alternative to the closeness centrality index for disconnected networks . The author showed that the results are the same on connected networks with the same computational complexity. The main benefit is that it can be used for disconnected networks.\nIn real-world social networks, a node can be part of multiple communities that gives birth to overlap community structure. Tarkowski et al. defined closeness centrality for the networks having overlapped community structure . They used a cooperative game-theoretic approach to compute the closeness centrality of a node in polynomial time complexity. They also verified their results on Warsaw public transportation networks. Still, the use of game-theoretic approaches for other centrality measures like betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, is an open problem.\nBarzinpour et al. extended closeness centrality for multilayer networks . He explained how inter-connections and intra-connections of layers could be used to get the true position of a node based on closeness centrality.\nYu et al. combined closeness centrality and degree centrality to identify important nodes in the given network . The algorithm is defined as,\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Calculate the shortest distance matrix of the given graph.\n\\item Calculate node importance evaluation matrix using degree centrality. This is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$E=\\begin{bmatrix}\nk_1 & a_{12}k_1k_2/2m & \\cdots & a_{1n}k_1k_n/2m\\\\\na_{21}k_1k_2/2m & k_2 & \\cdots & a_{2n}k_2k_n/2m \\\\\n\\vdots  & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n1}k_1k_n/2m & a_{n2}k_2k_n/2m & \\cdots  & k_n\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $k_i$ is degree of node $i$.\n\\item Improve node importance evaluation matrix using closeness centrality.\n\\begin{center}\n$H=\\begin{bmatrix}\nk_1C_1 & a_{12}k_1k_2C_2/2m & \\cdots & a_{1n}k_1k_nC_n/2m\\\\\na_{21}k_1k_2C_1/2m & k_2C_2 & \\cdots & a_{2n}k_2k_nC_n/2m \\\\\n\\vdots  & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n1}k_1k_nC_1/2m & a_{n2}k_2k_nC_2/2m & \\cdots  & k_nC_n\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $C_i$ is closeness centrality of node $i$.\n\\item Calculate importance of each node using given formula that is defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$I_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}H_{ij} = k_iC_i + \\sum_{j=1,i\\neq j}^{n} H_{ij}$\n\\end{center}\n\\end{enumerate}\nThus, the proposed centrality metric considers both local and global information of the node.

Cohen et al. proposed a method to approximate closeness centrality for directed and undirected networks . The proposed approach is a combination of the exact and sampling method. In the sampling method, few nodes are sampled uniformly at random, and BFT is executed from these nodes. The execution of these BFTs will determine the shortest paths of all nodes with the sampled nodes. In the hybrid approach, while calculating the closeness centrality of a node, a threshold distance is decided. Now to compute the closeness centrality of a node, its exact distance is computed with all nodes within the threshold distance. For all nodes which fall outside the threshold distance, two approaches are used: 1. If the node is a sampled node, its exact distance is already known; otherwise 2. approximation method is used to approximate the shortest distance of the node.

Their results help us understand that betweenness centrality can measure the interdisciplinarity of journals using local citation environments.

Before this work, researchers used to consider both of these centrality measures independently. This was the first work of its kind that show the inter-dependency of both centrality measures mathematically. Real-world scale-free networks can be categorized into three categories based on the average nearest neighbor degree: 1. assortative networks, 2. disassortative networks, and 3. neutral networks . In assortative networks, a node with a high degree tends to be connected with other nodes having high degrees. Few examples of assortative networks are social networks, co-authorship networks, actor networks, and so on. In disassortative networks, a node with a high degree tends to be connected with other nodes having low degrees and vice versa, for example, Internet network, WWW network, biological networks, and so on. Goh et al. studied the correlation of betweenness centrality in scale-free networks . Results show that the betweenness centrality correlation behaves the same in disassortative and neutral networks.

Xing and Ghorbani  extended the page rank for weighted networks and proposed the weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR). The WPR method considers the importance of the links and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the nodes. The results show that the WPR method performs better than the classic PageRank method in terms of finding the relevant pages to a given search query. Pagerank has also been extended for temporal networks , multilayer networks , and hypergraphs .\nFiala  extended the pagerank for bibliographic networks as in these networks, we have temporal and meta-information about the citations and authors. The proposed methods weigh citations between authors based on the information from the co-authorship network, and the methods were tested on the Web of Science dataset of computer science journal articles to determine the most prominent computer scientists in the period of 1996–2005.\n\\subsubsection*{Customized Pagerank}\nMany research papers talk about the customized ranking and how to improve users' experience on the search engines. These specialized rankings are suitable for many particular applications. The main underlying idea of specialized ranking is based on the concept that the page importance is not absolute, but it depends on the particular needs of a search engine or a user. For example, If a user is searching for the list of all top institutes, then the home page of all these institutes will not be so important. He would like to get a page that has consolidated information of all top institutes with their rankings. Specialized pagerank also can consider the user history and preferences to decide the order to display search query results. For example, different institutes might be interested in customizing the ranking algorithm for the specific environment. Scarselli et al. proposed a neural network model to compute customized page ranks in World Wide Web . Many approaches have been proposed for specialized page ranking based on the topic, user, or search query .

They show $60\\%$ average precision as observed by the human subjects. There are also some other studies that show the correlation of pagerank with in-degree in web network . The plot between pagerank and in-degree follows power-law distribution with a broad tail having power-law exponent $\\gamma \\approx 2.1$. Grolmusz showed that the pagerank in an undirected graph is not directly proportional to the degree . They proposed an upper and a lower bound for the pagerank distribution and explained necessary and sufficient conditions for the PageRank to be proportional to the degree.\nLitvak et al. performed experiments and observed that the pagerank and in-degree both obey the power law with the same exponent . They presented a mathematical model using a stochastic equation to explain this phenomenon. They also showed that the tail behavior of the PageRank and the in-degree differs only by a multiplicative factor, and derived a closed-form expression for the same. They have further worked to propose Monte Carlo methods to identify top-k personalized PageRank lists . There are few other works that propose efficient approaches to identify top-k nodes based on the requirement .\nIn 2008, Fortunato et al. used the mean-field theory to understand the correlation of pagerank with in-degree of the node . They showed that the pagerank is directly proportional to the in-degree, modulo an additive constant. They also showed that the global ranking $R(P)$ of a node based on pagerank $P$ could be defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$R(P) \\approx AP^{-\\beta}$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $\\beta = \\gamma - 1 \\approx 1.1$. $\\gamma$ is the power law exponent of pagerank distribution and $A$ is a proportionality constant.\nThis complete process includes following steps:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Compute pagerank of a node using following equation:\n\\begin{center}\n$P(k) = \\frac{q}{n} + \\frac{1-q}{n}\\frac{k_{in}}{\\left\\langle k_{in}\\right\\rangle }$\n\\end{center}\nThis gives the average PageRank of all nodes having degree $k$.\n\\item Compute the global rank $R(P)$ of the node\n\\item A page with global ranking $R$ can be placed at any position in the hit list of length $h$ based on the query.

The proposed method shows the speedup of 2.1, and the spearman correlation of ranking with pagerank is 0.95. Kamwar et al. proposed a technique to rank nodes in large real-world directed networks . They partitioned the link matrix into blocks, and the local ranking of each node is calculated in the corresponding block. Then the block level rank is used to estimate the global rank of the node. This method will give fast results as we can use a distributed computing environment to calculate local ranks in different blocks. Shariaty also analyzed the impact of neighbors on the pagerank of a node and proposed an approximation method based on local neighborhood information . There are some other works that use local information to estimate pagerank value .\nRichardson et al. proposed a machine learning based approach to approximate static pagerank values using user history and other static features . Liu et al. used two sampling methods, 1. direct sampling and 2. adaptive sampling, to approximate google pagerank values . The direct sampling method samples the transition matrix once and uses the sample directly in PageRank computation, whereas the adaptive sampling method samples the transition matrix multiple times. In adaptive sampling, the sample rate can be adjusted iteratively as the computing procedure proceeds. They have simulated the methods on six real-world datasets, and results show that the proposed methods can achieve higher computational efficiency. Luh used a latent semantic analysis approach to approximate Google pagerank .\nIn pagerank algorithm, we can also modify the sampling technique to converge the values faster or to get the application specific results. Boldi et al. analyzed the crawl strategies and studied whether the results obtained by partial crawling can be used to represent global ranking or not . They analyze when the crawling process can be stopped to announce the result that is very close to the actual ranking of the nodes. They performed the experiment on real-world networks and compared the ranking using Kendall's coefficient . Results show that if the sampling strategy computes the pagerank quickly, then it is badly correlated with the actual ranking. But the results are opposite for synthetic random graphs.\nKeong et al. proposed a modified random surfer model, which makes the number of iterations required to compute PageRank more predictable . They showed that 30 iterations are enough to accumulate the total PageRank up to 0.992, and 50 iterations are enough to accumulate the total PageRank up to 0.9997 theoretically. Borgatti et al. studied the effect of sampling on different centrality measures like degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality . They showed that the accuracy of centrality measures decreases as the sample size decreases. Maiya et al. also studied the impact of sampling techniques to identify highly influential nodes .\nHaveliwala presented convergence results for deciding the number of iterations that are required to get stable pagerank values . Yu et al. proposed IRWR (Incremental Random Walk with Restart) approach to update the pagerank in $O(1)$ time in dynamic networks . Mainly they proposed a fast incremental algorithm that shows high efficiency and exactness for computing proximities whenever an edge is updated. Sarma et al. proposed random walk based distributed algorithms for computing pagerank in directed and undirected graphs . The first approach takes $O(logn/q)$ rounds in both directed and undirected networks, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and $q$ is the teleportation factor. They also proposed a faster algorithm for undirected networks that takes $O(\\sqrt{logn}/q)$ rounds.

Garas et al. extended the k-shell method to identify core-periphery structure in weighted networks . They define the weighted degree that considers both the degree as well as the weights of the connected edges. Then the weighted degree is used while applying the k-shell decomposition method. Eidsaa and Almaas also proposed a method to identify core-periphery structure in weighted networks where they only consider the strength of the nodes while pruning them in each iteration , and this method is referred to as S-shell or strength decomposition algorithm. The strength of a node is defined as, $s_i=\\sum_{j \\epsilon \\Gamma (i)} W_{ij}$, where $W_{ij}$ denotes the weight of an edge connecting nodes $i$ and $j$. Wei et al. proposed an edge-weighting k-shell method where they consider both the degree as well as the edge-weights and the edge weight is computed by adding the degree of its two end points . The importance of both of these parameters can be set using a tuning parameter, which varies from 0 to 1. If it is set to 0, then the complete importance is given to edge-weights, and if it is set to 1, then the complete importance is given to the degree of the node.\nShell-index assigns the same index values to many nodes, which actually might have different influential power . Zeng et al. modified the k-shell decomposition method and proposed a mixed degree decomposition (MDD) method, which considers both the residual degree and the exhausted degree of the nodes while assigning them index values . Liu et al. proposed an improved ranking method that considers both the k-shell value of the node and its distance with the highest k-shell value nodes . The proposed method computes the shortest distance of all nodes with the highest k-shell nodes, so it has high computational complexity. Liu et al. showed that some core-like groups are formed in real-world networks, which are not true-core . The nodes in these groups are tightly connected with each other but have very few links outside. Based on this observation, authors filtered out redundant links with low diffusion power but support non-pure core groups to be formed and then apply k-shell decomposition methods. The authors show that the coreness computed on this new graph is a better metric of influential power, and it is highly correlated with spreading power computed using the SIR model in the original graph. \nResearchers also have proposed hybrid centrality measures by combining the k-shell with other existing centrality measures. Hou et al. introduced the concept of all-around score to find influential nodes . All around score of a node can be defined as, $Score=\\sqrt{\\left \\| d \\right \\|^2 + \\left \\| C_B \\right \\| ^2 +\\left \\| k_s \\right \\|^2 }$, where $d$ is the degree, $C_B$ is the betweenness centrality, and $k_s$ is the shell-index of the node. The degree takes care of local connectivity of the node, betweenness takes care of shortest paths that represent global information, and k-shell represents the position of the node with respect to the center. The total time complexity of the complete process is $O(nm)$, as it depends on the complexity of betweenness centrality that has the highest complexity. Basaras et al. proposed a hybrid centrality measure based on degree and shell-index and showed that it works better than the traditional shell-index . Bae and Kim proposed a method where the centrality value of a node is computed based on its neighbors' shell-index value; it thus considers both degree and shell-index value of the nodes . The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in scale-free networks with community structure. Tatti and Gionis proposed a graph decomposition method that considers both the connectivity as well as the local density while the k-shell decomposition method only considers the connectivity of the nodes . The running time of the proposed algorithm is $O(|V|^2|E|)$. They further proposed a linear-time algorithm that computes a factor-2 approximation of the optimal decomposition value. All the proposed centrality measures have better monotonicity, but all these measures require global information of the network to be computed, and so, they are not favorable in large-scale networks.

Saxena et al. showed the importance of core nodes in information diffusion on the networks having mesoscale structures . Several other works support the fact that core-nodes play a crucial role in making information viral . The k-shell method has also been used to identify influential leaders in the communities based on their influence propagation .\nCatini et al. used shell-index to identify clusters in PubMed scientific publications . To identify the clusters, a graph is created where the nodes are the publications. There is an edge between two nodes if the distance between the corresponding researchers' locations is less than the threshold. In the experiments, the authors have taken the threshold of 1 km. Based on the k-shell decomposition, the authors categorize the cities into monocore and multicore. Later on, the journal impact factors are used to quantify the quality of research of each core. Results show that the k-shell decomposition method can be used to identify the research hub clusters.\nCore-periphery structure has been studied in a wide variety of networks, such as financial networks , human-brain networks , nervous system of C. elegans worm , blog-networks , collaboration network , protein interaction networks , communication network of software development team , hollywood collaboration network , language network , youtube social interaction network , metabolic networks  etc. Carmi et al. used k-shell decomposition method to analyze the hierarchical structure of the network .

Researchers have combined some of these centrality measures or extended them to define new centrality measures based on the requirement. In this section, we will discuss some of these centrality measures with their specific properties.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item All-around Score: Identification of the most influential nodes in complex networks is an important issue for more efficient spread of the information. Hou et al. introduced the concept of all-around score to find influential nodes . All around score of a node can be defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$d=\\sqrt{\\left \\| k \\right \\|^2 + \\left \\| C_B \\right \\| ^2 +\\left \\| C_S \\right \\|^2 }$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $k$ is the degree, $C_B$ is the betweenness centrality, and $C_S$ is the k-shell index of the node. Thus, we consider three metrics to define the importance of a node. The degree takes care of local connectivity of the node, betweenness takes care of shortest paths that represent global information, and k-shell represents the position of the node with respect to the center. The total time complexity of the complete process is $O(nm)$, as it depends on the complexity of betweenness centrality that has the highest complexity. Results show that the all-around distance could be a more effective and stable indicator to show the influential power of a node.\n\\item Alpha Centrality: Eigenvector centrality does not give good results in some specific kind of networks. Bonacich et al. proposed a centrality measure called alpha centrality that gives similar results as eigenvector centrality . It gives good comparable results for the networks where eigenvector centrality can not be applied. Alpha centrality can be defined as,\n\\begin{center}\n$x=\\alpha A^T x + e$\n\\end{center}\nwhere $e$ is a vector having extra information. Parameter $\\alpha$ is used to represent the relative importance of endogenous versus exogenous factors. The matrix solution can be written as,\n\\begin{center}\n$x=(I - \\alpha A^T)^{-1}e$\n\\end{center}\nNewman et al. showed that under some conditions, the efficacy of eigenvector centrality is impaired, as it gives more importance to a small number of nodes in the network . This mainly happens in the networks having hubs or power-law degree distribution. So, they proposed an alternative centrality measure based on the nonbacktracking matrix that gives similar results in dense networks. However, it gives better results where the eigenvector centrality is failed. The complexity of the new centrality measure is the same as the standard one, so it can be easily used for large real-world networks. \n\\item Synthesize Centrality ($SC(u)$): Liu et al. defined synthesize centrality to identify opinion leaders in social networks . Opinion leaders have an important influence on information propagation, so it is important to efficiently identify them to understand this dynamic phenomenon. Synthesize centrality is defined as follows:\n\\begin{center}\n$SC(u)= \\frac{C_D(u) + C_B(u)}{C_C(u)}$\n\\end{center}\nExperimental results show that if a node is identified as an opinion leader using SC centrality, then there is a high probability that it will be an opinion leader using HITS and PageRank. The proposed method has high efficiency, and its accuracy is increased as the number of opinion leaders increase.\n\\item C-Index: Yan et al. studied the competence of researchers in a weighted collaboration network and proposed a centrality measure called C-index based on that . The c-index is computed using the degree, strength, and centrality information of the neighbors of the node. They show that C-index is highly correlated with the competence of the collaboration network. It follows power-law distribution in the weighted scale-free networks. They also propose two more extensions of the c-index centrality measure called iterative c-index and cg-index.\n\\item Sociability Centrality Index: This centrality metric is used to measure the social skill of a node in a large scale social network . The proposed centrality measure is based on TOPSIS and Genetic Algorithm. All other centrality measures that we have discussed measure the importance of the node based on its topological location in the network. But the social importance of the node depends on some other features also. The proposed metric considers the psychological and sociological features with the topological location to socially rank a node. The proposed centrality measure is tested on real-world datasets, and it outperforms other existing measures to rank nodes based on social skills.\n\\end{enumerate}", "cites": [7925], "cite_extract_rate": 0.14285714285714285, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section goes beyond a simple description by integrating multiple papers and highlighting the motivation behind new centrality measures.
