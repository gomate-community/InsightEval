In practical terms, to split the layout means to hide some connections from the untrusted foundry. The security provided by Split Manufacturing is based on the fact that the attacker in the FEOL foundry cannot infer the missing BEOL connections. This assumption, however, was challenged by several works where authors proposed attack approaches that can potentially retrieve the missing connections with varying degrees of success. In the text that follows, we present works that proposed Split Manufacturing attacks. These attacks are discussed in chronological order as compiled in Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_desc}. For each studied attack, we reported the related threat model, attack type, novelty, and benchmark circuits used in experiments. Additionally, we reported the largest and average size of the circuits utilized in each work (measured in number of gates). The circuit size is an important metric when analyzing the Split Manufacturing technique because its effectiveness is often proportional to circuit size. In Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}, we compiled results for when the smallest and largest studied circuits are under attack. Also, we reported the circuit size and, if defined, the split layer that the author selected to split the circuit at.\nThe first reported attack is by Jeyavijayan \\etal~and is described in . In this work, the authors assumed that naive Split Manufacturing (i.e., splitting a layout without care for the connections) is inherently insecure. They introduced the concept of proximity attacks that exploits ``vulnerabilities'' introduced by EDA design tools. Since EDA tools focus on optimizing for PPA, the solution found by a placement algorithm tends to place logically connected cells close to one another so they become physically connected during routing. Therefore, the distance between output-input pairs can be used as a metric to recover the missing BEOL connections.\n\\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt)[width=0.90\\linewidth]{partitions.pdf}\n{Example of a partitioned circuit. \\label{fig:cir_part}}\nDesigns are commonly partitioned during physical implementation, i.e., separated into small logical blocks with few connections between them. That way, the designer has total control of the floorplaning regarding the placement of blocks. This approach also allows for blocks to be implemented separately and later integrated, creating a sense of parallelism in the design flow which can reduce the overall time required for executing physical synthesis. Consider as an example the circuit illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:cir_part} which contains two partitions, A and B, each with 3 gates. Partition A has 3 input pins and one output pin, while partition B has three input pins and two output pins. The partitions have only one connection between them, connecting the output pin of gate G2 with one of the inputs of gate G3. Consider a target output pin from partition A $P_{x,A,out}$ and its corresponding candidate input pin from partition B $P_{x,B,in}$. During placement, the EDA tool will attempt to place the pin $P_{x,A,out}$ as close as possible to $P_{x,B,in}$, possibly closer than any other pin in partition B. Using this insight, an attacker may recover the missing connections in the FEOL layout, performing then a proximity attack. The authors argued that their proposed attack flow is successful due to being able to leverage the following ``hints'' provided by the EDA tools:\n  \\begin{itemize}\n      \\item[] \\textit{Hint 1 - Input-Output Relationship}: partition input pins are connected either to another partition output pin or to an input port of the IC (i.e., input to input connections are excluded from the search space).\n      \\item[] \\textit{Hint 2 - Unique Inputs per Partition}: input-output pins between partitions are connected by only one net. If a single partition output pin feeds more than one input pin, the fan-in and fan-out nodes are usually placed within the partitions (i.e., one-to-many connections are ruled out from the search space). \n      \\item[] \\textit{Hint 3 - Combinational Loops}: in general, only very specific structures are allowed to utilize combinational loops (e.g., ring oscillators). These structures are very easy to identify. In most cases, random logic does not contain combinational loops (i.e., connections that would lead to combinational loops can be excluded from the search space).\n  \\end{itemize}\nAn attacker can correctly connect a target pin to a candidate pin by identifying the closest pin from a list of possible candidates. The list of possible candidates is created by observing the hints mentioned above. A possible candidate pin is an unassigned output pin of another partition and an unassigned input port of the design. Then, a minimum distance metric is used to connect the pins based on the previously discussed heuristic behavior of EDA tools.\nIn Algorithm \\ref{alg:prox_jevs}, we described the proximity attack detailed in . The input to the algorithm is the FEOL layout, from which the information about unassigned input-output ports can be derived. The algorithm does not describe the specifics of how to derive a netlist from a layout. However, the complexity of this task is rather straightforward. It is assumed that the attacker possesses information about both the PDK and the standard cell library. In many cases, the untrusted foundry is the actual provider of both\\footnote{For the PDK, it is very natural that it is created by the untrusted foundry itself. For standard cell libraries, the cells might be designed by the foundry or by a third-party licensed by the foundry. In either case, the effort to revert a layout to a netlist remains trivial.}. From there, a layout in GDSII or OASIS format can be easily reverted to a netlist by any custom design EDA tool. \n\\begin{algorithm}[h]\n\\DontPrintSemicolon\n  \\KwInput{FEOL layers}\n  \\KwOutput{Netlist with BEOL connections}\n  Reverse engineer FEOL layers and obtain partitions;\n   \\While{Unassigned partition pins or ports exist}\n   {\n   Select arbitrary unassigned pin/port as a targetPin;\n   \tListOfCandPins = BuildCandPinsList(targetPin);\n   \tSelect candPin from ListOfCandPins that is closest to targetPin;\n   \tConnect targetPin and candPin;\n   \tUpdate netlist;\n   }\n   \\textbf{Return:} netlist\n   \\textbf{BuildCandPinsList}(targetPin)\n   \\KwInput{targetPin $P_{X,i,in}$}\n  \\KwOutput{CandPins for targetPin}\n  CandPins = Unassigned output pins of other partitions + unassigned input ports of the design;\n  \\For{\\textbf{each} $Pin_J \\in$ CandPins}\n   {\n    \\If{CombinationalLoop(targetPin, $Pin_J$)}\n    {\n        CandPins -= $Pin_J$;\n    }\n   }\n   \\textbf{Return:} CandPins\n\\caption{Proximity attack}\n\\label{alg:prox_jevs}\n\\end{algorithm}\nFrom the gate-level netlist, the algorithm chooses an arbitrary \\textit{TargetPin} from the unassigned partition input pins and output ports, creates a list of possible \\textit{CandidatePins}, and then connects the \\textit{TargetPin} to the closest pin in this list. After each connection, the netlist is updated. This procedure is repeated until all unassigned ports are connected. When the procedure is over, the attacker obtains the possible missing BEOL connections. If all guesses were correct, the original design has been recovered and Split Manufacturing has been defeated.\n \\begin{table*}[htb]\n \\rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Threat Models, Attacks, and Metrics.}\n    \\begin{tabular}{ccclp{4.0cm}lp{1.7cm}p{1.2cm}}\n    \\hline \\hline \\\\ [-1.5ex]\n        \\textbf{Work} & \\textbf{Year} & \\parbox{1cm}{\\textbf{Threat} \\\\\\textbf{model}} & \\textbf{Attack type } & \\textbf{Novelty} & \\textbf{Benchmark suite(s)} & \\parbox{2cm}{\\textbf{Largest circuit} \\\\\\textbf{size (gates)}} & \\parbox{2cm}{\\textbf{Avg. circuit} \\\\\\textbf{size (gates)} } \\vspace{1pt} \\\\ \n        \\hline\n          & 2013 &  I & Proximity & Attack Based on Proximity & ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 & 3.51k & 1288\\\\\n          & 2016 &  II & Proximity  & \\parbox{4.5cm}{Placement and routing proximity \\\\ used in conjunction} & ISPD\\textquotesingle11 & 1.29M & 951k \\\\\n          & 2018 &  I & Proximity & \\parbox{4.5cm}{Network-Flow-Based with  Design \\\\ Based Hints} & ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 \\& ITC\\textquotesingle99 & 190.21k & 9856\\\\\n          & 2018 & I & Proximity & \\parbox{4.5cm}{Proximity Attack Based on Machine \\\\ Learning} & ISPD\\textquotesingle11 &  1.29M & 951k\\\\\n          & 2019 &  I & SAT  & SAT Attack without Proximity Information & ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 \\& ITC\\textquotesingle99 & 190.21k & 9856\\\\\n          & 2019 & I & SAT & \\parbox{4.5cm}{SAT attack dynamically adjusted \\\\based on proximity information} &  ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 \\& ITC\\textquotesingle99 & 190.21K & 9856\\\\\n         \\hline \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\label{tab:atcks_desc}\n\\end{table*}\nAlgorithm \\ref{alg:prox_jevs} was originally applied to the ISCAS\\textquotesingle85  suite of benchmark circuits. These circuits were originally selected and published to help in comparing automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) tools. Due to the small size of these circuits, they may not be the best option to assess the effectiveness of Split Manufacturing. The difficulty to retrieve the BEOL connections is directly proportional to the size of the circuit. The authors reported an average effectiveness of 96\\% of Correct Connection Rate (CCR) across all the benchmarks considered. For the c17 circuit (smallest circuit in the ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 suite with only 6 gates), all the connections were retrieved correctly, thus demonstrating that the algorithm is capable of retrieving the missing BEOL connections. In Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}, we highlight the best and worst results in terms of CCR.\nJeyavijayan \\etal  were the first to question the security of straightforward Split Manufacturing. Their proximity attack showed promising results, even if the considered benchmark circuits were rather small in size. This was the starting point for other studies proposing different attacks to Split Manufacturing in an attempt to retrieve the missing BEOL connections. Improvements over the original proximity attack, as well as other attacks, are compiled in Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_desc}. \nThe effectiveness of the proximity attack utilizing distance of unassigned pins alone as metric to find missing BEOL connections was questioned by Maga\\~na \\etal . The authors proposed to utilize both placement and routing information in augmented proximity attacks. For their results, large-sized circuits from the ISPD-2011 routability-driven placement contest  were used. These benchmarks are better representatives of modern circuits as they contain 9 metal layers and up to two million nets in a design. Thus, in an attempt to increase the success rate of the attack for large-sized circuits, they proposed routing-based proximity in conjunction with placement-centric proximity attacks.\n \\begin{table*}[htb]\n \\rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}\n    \\centering\n       \\caption{Benchmark Size and Comparison of Attack Results.}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cllcllc}\n    \\hline \\hline \\\\ [-1.5ex]\n        \\textbf{Work} & \\textbf{Benchmark} & \\textbf{Attack} & \\textbf{Split Layer} & \\textbf{Size (In Gate Count)} & \\textbf{Metric} & \\textbf{Result}  \\vspace{5pt} \\\\\n        \\hline\n         & c17 & Proximity & Not Defined & 6 & CCR(\\%) & 100 \\\\\n          & c7552 & Proximity & Not Defined & 3513 & CCR(\\%) & 94  \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Placement Proximity & M2 & 847k & \\% Match in List & 12.84 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Placement Proximity & M2 & 847k & CCR(\\%)  & 5.479 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Routing Proximity & M2 & 847k & \\% Match in List & 71.08 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Routing Proximity & M2 & 847k & CCR(\\%)  & 0.651 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Overlap (P\\&R) Proximity & M2 & 847k & \\% Match in List & 13.05 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Overlap (P\\&R) Proximity & M2 & 847k & CCR(\\%)  & 3.977 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Crouting Proximity & M2 & 847k & \\% Match in List & 82.08 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Crouting Proximity & M2 & 847k & CCR(\\%)  & 0.651 \\\\\n           &  c7552 & Network-flow Based Proximity & Not Defined & 3513 & CCR(\\%) & 93 \\\\\n           &  c7552 & Proximity & Not Defined & 3513 & CCR(\\%) & 42 \\\\\n           &  B18 & Network-flow Based Proximity & Not Defined & 94249 & CCR(\\%) & 17 \\\\\n           &  B18 & Proximity & Not Defined & 94249 & CCR(\\%) & < 1 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Proximity & M6 & 847k & \\% Match in list & 33.40 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & Proximity & M6 & 847k & CCR(\\%) & 0.76 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & ML & M6 & 847k & \\% Match in list & 83.12 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & ML & M6 & 847k & CCR(\\%) & 1.91 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & ML-imp & M6 & 847k & \\% Match in list & 74.65 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & ML-imp & M6 & 847k & CCR(\\%) & 2.11 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & ML-imp & M4 & 847k & \\% Match in list & 75.45 \\\\\n          & Superblue 1 & ML-imp & M4 & 847k & CCR(\\%) & 2.58 \\\\\n          & c7552 & SAT Attack & Not Defined & 3513 & Logical Equivalence(\\%) & 100 \\\\\n          & B18   & SAT Attack & Not Defined & 94249 & Logical Equivalence(\\%) & 100 \\\\\n          & c7552 & Improved SAT Attack & Not Defined & 3513 & Logical Equivalence(\\%) & 100 \\\\\n          & B18   & Improved SAT Attack & Not Defined & 94249 & Logical Equivalence(\\%) & 100 \\\\\n    \\hline \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\label{tab:atcks_effect}\n\\end{table*}\nA key difference present in  is that this work utilizes a different threat model (model II), claiming that the untrusted foundry possesses information about the entire place \\& routed netlist (as well as the FEOL layout). This assumption is hard to reason if the attacker's intent was to overproduce the IC or pirate the IP. For these goals, clearly, this assumption is unnecessary. The attacker himself can, if he indeed possesses the netlist, perform his own physical synthesis and generate his own layout. The interest in reverse engineering the BEOL connections of the original design diminishes. Nevertheless, we report on the strategies employed by the authors of  since they build on the approach proposed by .\n\\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt)[width=0.90\\linewidth]{sa_onlycir.pdf}\n{Representation of the routing for the first 3 metal layers of a simple circuit (adapted from ). \\label{fig:circ_abs}}\nRegarding the attacks, the authors of  proposed four different techniques to identify a small search neighborhood for each pin. The goal is to create a neighborhood that is small enough to make further pruning feasible, and therefore increase the likelihood of including the matching pins. The techniques are called \\textit{placement proximity}, \\textit{routing proximity}, \\textit{crouting proximity} and \\textit{overlap of placement and routing proximity}, and are described in the text that follows. The circuit illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:circ_abs} is the example (before the split) that will guide the discussion on these four techniques.\n\\textit{Placement proximity} exploits the placement information of cells. Each split wire is taken from the pin location of the corresponding standard cell that is connected to it. A search neighborhood is defined as a square region centered around the corresponding pin with an area equal to the average areas of the bounding boxes (BB) in a typical design. The authors argued that it can also be measured based on BBs of the non-split wires in the design under attack, under the assumption that the number of wires that remain in the FEOL is also very large in practice. Let us consider the circuit illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:circ_abs} as an example. If the split is done at M2, the search area defined using the placement proximity would contain three gates as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prox_sa} (a). Thus, using the placement proximity search area, the most likely connections are illustrated by the green squares (candidate pins) and by the red squares (target pins). Note that the layer at which the layout is split does not affect the search area defined by placement proximity.\n\\textit{Routing proximity} exploits the routing information. First, for each split wire, pins are identified as the point where the wire is actually cut at the split layer, i.e., the via location. Next, a square area centered around those pins is defined. The size of the square area is defined based on the average BBs of the pins on that layer in the design. This procedure for identification results in different neighborhood sizes according to the split layer location, i.e., the search radius adapts to the routing resources of each layer. A search area defined using routing proximity is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prox_sa} (b), highlighted in gray and containing a set of routing wires and its respective pins.  \n\\textit{Crouting proximity} takes into account routing congestion by exploiting the union of placement and routing proximity. The search area for each pin is defined in such way that the ratio of number of pins to the search area is equal across all the pins in the split layer. Thus, if a pin is located at a high routing congestion area, the search area will be expanded until the pin density in the new search area reaches a target value or the search area grows to four times its starting value. The starting value is set according to the split layer, set as the average of numbers of pins which fall within a BB. A search area defined using crouting proximity is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prox_sa} (c). \nThe last strategy proposed by  also combines placement and routing information. It is referred to as \\textit{Overlap of placement and routing proximities}. The concept here is to include a subset of pins identified by the placement proximity list which have their corresponding pins included in the routing proximity list. According to the author, intuitively, the overlap then identifies a subset of pins which may be more likely to point towards the direction of the matching pin. A search area defined using the overlap of placement and routing proximities is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:prox_sa} (d). \n \\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt)[width=1\\linewidth]{prox_sa_new.pdf}\n{Multiple strategies for pin/connectivity search areas according to . \\label{fig:prox_sa}}\nMaga\\~na et al.  assessed each strategy using the benchmark circuit \\textit{superblue1}. Different split layers were also considered. In Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}, we compiled the results for split layer M2. By comparing the results, it becomes clear that no strategy was able to recover 100\\% of the missing BEOL connections. The best result was only 5.479\\% of CCR. This is in heavy contrast with the findings of . However, as we previously noted, the circuit sizes differ by orders of magnitude.\nAccording to the authors of , proximity alone is in no way sufficient to reverse engineer the FEOL. However, proximity attacks have merit as they can be used to narrow down the list of candidates to a significantly smaller size. Using crouting proximity, in 82.08\\% of the cases, the search area defined contained the matched pin in the list of candidates. The authors also present results for a circuit split at M8. We opt not to show these results in Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}. Using the circuit \\textit{superblue1} as an example, the number of unassigned pins when the circuit is split at M8 is only 1.2\\% of the pins when split at M2. Therefore, the small number of unassigned pins to be connected overshadows the large circuit used for their experiments. It must also be emphasized that splitting a circuit in such higher layers is rather impractical since M8 tends to be a very thick metal reserved for power distribution in typical 10-metal stacks. There is very little value in hiding a power distribution network from an adversary that wants to pirate an IP. Once again, we opt not to show this result in our comparisons.\nA network-flow based attack model towards flattened designs was proposed by Wang et. al . The authors argued that the proximity attack originally proposed by  utilizes hints that can be used only by hierarchical designs, and that modern designs are often flattened \\footnote{We highlight that best practices in circuit design have changed over the years. Hierarchical design was heavily utilized for many years, but it lost favor due to the difficulty in performing reasonable timing budgeting between the many blocks of a system. Thus, flattened designs are often used to facilitate timing closure.}. Based on the original proximity attack, they proposed a proximity attack utilizing five hints: physical proximity, acyclic combinational logic circuit, load capacitance constraint, directionality of dangling wires, and timing constraint. Note that the first two hints are already described by  and . The three novel hints are described below:\n \\begin{itemize}\n     \\item[] \\textit{Load Capacitance Constraint}: gates can drive a limited load to honor slew constraints. Typically, maximum load capacitance is constrained and has a maximum value defined by the PDK and/or the standard cell characterization boundaries. Hence, an attacker will consider only connections that will not violate load capacitance constraints.\n     \\item[] \\textit{Directionality of Dangling Wires}: routing engines tend to route wires from a source to a sink node along the direction of the sink node. Therefore, the directionality of remaining dangling wires at lower metal layers may indicate the direction of their destination cell with a high degree of certainty\\footnote{Metals usually have preferred directions that alternate along the stack (i.e., if M1 is vertical, then M2 is horizontal). Therefore, this hint becomes more effective if the attacker can observe more than one routing layer of the FEOL}. An attacker can disregard connections in the other directions.\n     \\item[] \\textit{Timing Constraint}: connections that create timing paths that violate timing constraints can be excluded. An attacker, through an educated guess of the clock period, can determine a conservative timing constraint and exclude any connections that would lead to slower paths. \n \\end{itemize}\nThe network-flow based attacked framework proposed by Yang \\etal~considers two hints proposed by  plus the aforementioned hints to create a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges. The set ($V$) is composed by the set of vertices corresponding to the output pins $V_o$, and a set corresponding to the input pins ($V_i$), the source vertex ($S$), and the target vertex ($T$). The set $E$ consists of $E_{So}$, edges from $S$ to every output pin vertex, $E_{oi}$, edges from output pin vertices to input pin vertices, and $E_{iT}$, which includes edges from every input vertex to the target vertex. An example of this kind of representation is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:network_flow}, where (a) is the circuit with missing connections and (b) is the network-flow representation. The detailed problem formulation is omitted from this work. To find the connections, a min-cost network-flow problem is solved, where the decision variables are the flow $x_{i,j}$ going through each edge $(i,j) \\in E$ . The authors utilized the Edmons-karp algorithm  to solve this problem. Complexity of the algorithm alone is given by $O(VE^2)$, however, in the worst case it is required to run the algorithm $V$ times; thus, the run-time of the complete network attack is given by $O(V^2E^2)$ in the worst case.\n\\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt)[width=0.90\\linewidth]{network_flow.pdf}\n{(a) Circuit with missing connections. (b) Network-flow model for inferring the missing connections. (Adapted from ). \\label{fig:network_flow}}\nThe network-flow approach was applied to ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 and ITC\\textquotesingle99  benchmark circuits. The ITC\\textquotesingle99 circuits were proposed as an evolution of the ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 set, since the Test community acknowledged that newer and larger circuits were already in demand. For comparison, the authors applied both the original proximity attack and the network-flow attack to flattened designs. As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}, their network-flow proximity attack outperformed the original attack in terms of CCR. However, despite the evident improvement, the attack could only retrieve 17\\% of the missing BEOL connections for a medium sized circuit (b18 from the ITC\\textquotesingle99 suite).\nA Machine Learning (ML) framework was used by Zhang \\etal  in an attempt to improve the attack proposed in . The same setup as previously discussed was utilized. However, more layout features were incorporated in their ML formulation, including placement, routing, cell sizes, and cell pin types. \nA high-level overview of their modeling framework is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:ml_framework} (a). First, they create a challenge instance from the entire layout and only FEOL view. Next, for each virtual pin (point where a net is broken on the split layer), layout information is collected, including placement, routing, cell areas, and cell pin as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:ml_framework} (b). Using this information, samples are generated which are fed into the ML training process. Each sample carries information of a pair of virtual pins which may or may not be matched. Classifiers then are built by the ML framework using training samples. After training and building the regression model, cross validation is used for evaluation which ensures validation of the model is done on data samples which were not used for training. Their framework faces scaling issues when applied to lower split metal layers. An improved ML framework is then proposed as well, denoted by ML-imp, to solve the scaling issues.\nFor their experiments, Zhang \\etal  utilize the ISPD\\textquotesingle11 benchmark suite. They compare results from their previous work  with their ML and ML-imp frameworks. However, they do not show results for lower split metal layers (e.g., M2). Instead, results are provided for M8, M6, and M4 splits. As pointed out before, utilizing higher layers for the split effectively shrinks the otherwise large circuits used in their experiments. A drastic reduction of unassigned pins is expected for such higher layers, as higher metal layers are used often for power routing, not for signal routing. Results for the \\textit{superblue1} circuit are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}. Regarding recovering missing BEOL connections, ML and ML-imp could only retrieve around 2\\%, therefore not showing a huge improvement over their previous work. However, search list area accuracy showed significantly better results when compared to their prior work. A caveat worth mentioning is that the proposed machine learning framework needs the entire layout during its modeling phase. This characteristic may, in an extreme case, nullify the applicability for an attacker that only holds the FEOL layout and cannot produce training samples from other sources.\n \\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt)[width=1\\linewidth]{ml_features.pdf}\n{(a) Machine Learning Modeling by Zhang et al. . (b) Few Exmples of Layout Features. \\label{fig:ml_framework}}\nAttacks using proximity information as a metric are not the only solution to recover missing BEOL connections. An effective methodology to apply a Boolean satisfiability based strategy is proposed by Chen \\etal . The authors claim that their attack methodology does not need (or depend on) any proximity information, or even any other insights into the nature of EDA tools utilized in the design process. The key insight in their work is to model the interconnect network as key-controlled multiplexers (MUX). Initially, all combinations of signal connections between the FEOL partitions are allowed, as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:mux_network}. First, a MUX network is created in order to connect all missing paths in the circuit. This MUX network leads to potential cyclic paths, thus, there is a possibility to generate many combinational loops during the attack process corresponding to incorrect key guesses. Therefore, constraints on the key values are generated in order to avoid activating the cyclic paths. The attack can be summarized in 4 steps: \\textit{identification of all cyclic paths}, \\textit{generation of cycle constraints}, \\textit{cycle constraints optimizations}, and finally, \\textit{SAT attack}. The authors utilize a SAT solver-based attack method derived from CycSat . The SAT attack algorithm has as input the FEOL circuit with MUX network and a packaged IC that serves as an oracle. The algorithm outputs keys to be used in the MUXes such that correct BEOL connections are made. \nIn reality,  presents a different interpretation of Threat model I since the attacker is assumed to possess a functional IC. This IC would then have to be available in the open market for the attacker to be able to purchase it. This characteristic severely narrows down the applicability of this SAT attack. For instance, ICs designed for space or military use will not be freely available, thus an oracle may not be known to the attacker.\nExperimental results presented by  utilize ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 and ITC\\textquotesingle99 benchmark circuits. It has been shown that their attack could recover a logically correct netlist for all the studied circuits. However, there is a small clarification to be made that relates to what is a logically correct circuit. In Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}, two of those results are shown. For seven of the studied benchmarks (c1908, c2670, c5315, c7552, b14, b15, b17), the connections recovered are identical to the BEOL connections. For the remaining benchmarks, the recovered connections are not identical but logically equivalent to the original circuit. In practice, the logically equivalent circuit may present performance deviations from the original design. Matching the performance of the original design can be done by re-executing place and route using the logically equivalent gate-level netlist. Depending on the attack goal, it is possible that the attacker had already planned to re-execute the physical synthesis flow again (say, to resell the IP in a different form or shape). An attack that guarantees 100\\% of logic equivalence of the recovered netlist is powerful enough, allowing attackers to copy and modify split layouts.\nIn order to increase the efficiency and capacity of the SAT attack proposed in , the authors proposed two improvements in . First, the size of the key-controlled interconnect network that models the possible BEOL connections is reduced. Second, after the MUX network is inserted into the FEOL circuit, the number of combinational cycles it induces in the design for incorrect key guesses should also be reduced. Proximity information is then exploited to achieve the proposed improvements. The improved SAT attack method which exploits proximity information showed significant reduction in the attack time and increase in the capacity. Same as in , the circuits tested were 100\\% recovered, as shown in Table~\\ref{tab:atcks_effect}. \n\\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt)[width=0.95\\linewidth]{mux_network.pdf}\n{MUX network for a bipartitioned FEOL circuit (Adapted from ). \\label{fig:mux_network}}\n\\begin{table*}[htb]\n\\rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Split Manufacturing Defenses.}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cp{1cm}ccp{2.2cm}p{2cm}l}\n    \\hline \\hline \\\\ [-1.5ex]\n      \\textbf{Work} & \\textbf{Year} & \\textbf{Threat Model} & \\textbf{Category} & \\textbf{Defense} & \\textbf{Metrics} & \\textbf{Defense Overheads Presented} \\vspace{5pt} \\\\\n      \\hline \n       & 2013 & I & Proximity Perturbation &Pin Swapping & Hamming Distance & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{-*} \\\\\n       & 2013 & II & Wire Lifting &Wire Lifting & k-Distance & Power, Area, Delay and Wire-Length \\\\\n       & 2014 &  I & Layout Obfuscation & Layout Obfuscation for SRAMs and Analog IPs & - & Performance, Power and Area \\\\\n      & 2014 & I & Layout Obfuscation & Obfuscation Techniques & Neighbor Connectedness and Entropy & Performance and Area \\\\\n      & 2015 & I & Layout Obfuscation & Automatic Obfuscation Cell Layout & Neighbor Connectedness and Entropy & Performance, Power and Area \\\\\n      & 2015 & I & Layout Obfuscation & Obfuscated Built-in Self-Authentication & Obfuscation Connection & Number of Nets \\\\\n      & 2016 & I & Wire Lifting & Artificial Blockage Insertion & Number of Pins & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{-*} \\\\\n      & 2016 & I & Wire Lifting & Net Partition, Cell Hidden and Pin Shaken & - &  \\multicolumn{1}{c}{-*} \\\\\n      & 2017 & I & Proximity Perturbation & Routing Perturbation & Hamming Distance & Performance and Wire-Length \\\\\n      & 2017 & I & Wire Lifting & Secure Routing Perturbation for Manufacturability & Hamming Distance & Performance and Wire-Length \\\\\n      & 2017 & I & Proximity Perturbation & placement-centric Techniques & CCR & Performance, Power and Area \\\\\n      & 2017 & II & Proximity Perturbation & Gate Swapping and Wire Lifting & Effective Mapped Set Ratio and Average Mapped Set Pruning Ratio & Wire-Length \\\\\n      & 2018 & I & Wire Lifting & Concerted Wire Lifting & Hamming Distance & Performance, Power and Area \\\\\n      & 2018 & I & Proximity Perturbation & Secure Driven Placement Perturbation & Hamming Distance & Power and Wire-Length\\\\\n      & 2018 & I & Proximity Perturbation & placement and routing perturbation & Hamming Distance & Performance, Power and Area \\\\\n      & 2019 & I & Layout Obfuscation & Isomorphic replacement for Cell Obfuscation & Isomorphic Entropy & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{-*} \\\\\n      & 2019 & II & Layout Obfuscation & Dummy Cell and Wire Insertion & k-security & Area and Wire-Length \\\\\n    \\hline \\hline\n      \\multicolumn{7}{l}{\\cellcolor{white}* Authors do not present any discussion regarding overhead.} \n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\label{tab:sm_defenses}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [7800, 7798, 7799], "cite_extract_rate": 0.13043478260869565, "origin_cites_number": 23, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes the concept of proximity attacks and ties together insights from multiple cited works, particularly those addressing vulnerabilities in Split Manufacturing.

The first category of defenses, Proximity Perturbation, addresses this hint left by the EDA tools. The goal of the techniques within this category is to promote changes in the circuit such that the proximity information between the FEOL pins is less evident. Therefore, the success rate of the proximity attacks is decreased.\nIn , the authors proposed pin swapping to overcome proximity attacks. Rearranging the partition pins can alter their distance in such a way that the attacker is deceived. As an example, if the pins $P_{G3,B,in}$ and $P_{G6,A,in}$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:cir_part}) are swapped, the proximity attack will incorrectly guess the connection between $P_{G2,A,out}$ and $P_{G3,B,in}$. Thus, a sufficient number of pins have to be swapped in order to create a netlist that is significantly different from the original netlist (based on some sort of metric for similarity). In , Hamming distance is proposed as a way to quantify the difference between the outputs of the original netlist and the modified netlist. Assuming the outputs of a circuit are arranged as a string of bits, Hamming distance is defined as the number of bits that change when two instances of this string are compared to one another. The authors argued that the optimum netlist is created when the Hamming distance is 50\\%. Therefore, inducing the maximal ambiguity for a potential attacker. Since the best rearrangement for N pins of partitions might take $N!$ computations (rather computationally expensive), pair-wise swapping of pins is considered in . Pair-wise swapping of pins results in $O(N^2)$ computations. \nThe modified netlist is created based on a series of rules. Similarly, to the proximity attack, a list of candidates pins to be swapped is created before the actual swap is applied. Since not every pin can be swapped, a candidate pin to be swapped should:\n   \\begin{itemize}\n       \\item be an output pin of the partition where the target pin resides\n       \\item not be connected to the partition where the candidate pin resides\n       \\item not form a combinational loop\n   \\end{itemize}\nUsing the above constraints, a candidate pin is selected. The target pin also needs to be chosen carefully. In , IC testing principles  and hints from the original proximity attack are used to choose the target pin. The swapping procedure is described in Algorithm \\ref{alg:pin_swap}, where $TestMetric$ is a metric based on IC testing principles, such as stuck-at fault models which are still utilized in Test today. More details can be obtained from . The proposed defense technique is validated using ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 circuits and the original proximity attack. For the smallest circuit, c17, it takes only one swap to achieve a Hamming Distance of 50\\%. For the largest studied circuit, c7552, it takes 49 swaps. These results are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res}.\nAs demonstrated in , rearranging the partition pins can thwart proximity attacks. However, according to Chen \\etal , pin swapping at partition level has limited efficacy. They demonstrated that an attacker holding the FEOL layout as well as the nestlist can insert hardware trojans even when the defense approach of  is applied. It must be highlighted that  assumes threat model II, which we have previously argued that has the potential to nullify the vast majority of defenses towards split circuits. Thus, they proposed a defense to counter the threat from hardware trojans. Their defense incorporates the global wire-length information, with the goal to hide the gates from their candidate locations, and as result decreasing the effective mapped set ratio (EMSR). The EMSR metric is an attempt to quantify the ratio of real gates location of a given mapping during a simulated annealing-based attack. This defense consists of two steps, first a greedy gate swapping defense , and second, a measurement of the security elevation in terms of EMSR. The technique is evaluated using ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 benchmarks circuits and the EMSR metric to quantify the defense effectiveness. The results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res}.\nFollowing the same principle of increasing the Hamming Distance, Wang \\etal  proposed a routing perturbation based defense. The optimum Hamming distance is sought to be achieved by layer elevation, routing detours, and wire decoys, while test principles are used to drive the perturbation choices. Layer elevation is essentially a wire lifting technique: without changing the choice of split metal layer, wires are forced to route using higher metal layers, thus being lifted from the FEOL to the BEOL. Intentional routing detours are a way to increase the distance between disconnected pins of the FEOL. If done properly, disconnected pins will not be the closest to each other, deceiving the proximity attack. In some cases, routing detours will increase the distance between disconnected pins, however, they still remain the closest to each other. In this scenario, wire decoys can be drawn near disconnected pins, in such a way that decoys are now the closest and will instead be picked as the ideal candidate pin. \nThe perturbations proposed in  can incur heavy overheads, and, for this reason, wires to be perturbed are chosen by utilizing IC test principles. In , fault observability, as defined in SCOAP , is used as a surrogate metric for this task. The technique is evaluated using ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 and ITC\\textquotesingle99 benchmark circuits. For all studied circuits, the Hamming distance increased by an average of 27\\% at a cost of only 2.9\\% wire length overhead (WLO), on average.

They utilized an information-theoretic metric to increase the resilience of a layout against proximity attacks. As demonstrated in , mutual information (MI) can be used to quantify the amount of information revealed by the connectivity distance between cells. Mutual information is calculated by taking into account the cells connectivity $D$, if they are connected or not, and their Manhattan distance $X$, described by Eq. \\ref{eq:mutual_info}, where $H[\\cdot]$ is the entropy. The Manhattan distance of two cells is defined as the sum of horizontal and vertical distances between them. Entropy is a measure of disorder of a system. Therefore, in this work, entropy is utilized as a measure of disorder in the FEOL layer. The distribution of the variable $X$ for a given layout is determined pair-wise for all gates, allowing a straightforward computation of $I(X;D)$. Thus, layouts with the lowest mutual information, i.e., the correlation between cell connectivity and their distance is low, are more resilient against proximity attacks.\n   \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:mutual_info}\n       MI = I(X;D) = H[X]-H[X/D]\n   \\end{equation}\nIn order to minimize the information ``leaked'' from mutual information,  applies cell placement randomization and three other techniques: g-color, g-type1, and g-type2. Randomizing the cell placement can achieve the desired low mutual information; however, the PPA overhead incurred is excessive. Minimizing mutual information without excessive PPA overhead can be achieved by the other techniques. From a graph representation of the circuit, graph coloring can be used to hide connectivity information, where gates of the same color must not be connected. Thus, the resulting colored netlist is then partitioned by clustering all cells of same color together. During cell placement, the cells with the same color will be confined within their respective clusters. According to , these constraints naturally mitigate the information leakage to a great extent. The g-color technique utilizes only the graph coloring as described above. The other two, g-type1 and g-type2, consider the type of the gate when creating clusters. The g-type1 approach clusters gates only by their functionality, while g-type2 utilizes functionality and the number of inputs for clustering. The authors assessed their techniques utilizing ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 and MNCN benchmark suites.

Differently from pin swapping, their placement-based defense considers the incurred wire-length overhead as a metric. This technique is based on changing gate locations such that the proximity hint is no longer effective. Their algorithm consists of two phases, one to select which gates to be perturbed and a second phase where the selected gates are (re)placed. Gate selection is done by extracting a set of trees using two techniques, BEOL-driven and logic-ware extraction. The first approach selects all gate trees that contain any metal wires in the FEOL, i.e., connections that are not hidden from the attacker. The second approach considers the wire-length impact and the gate tree impact on the overall security. After extracting the set of trees, the placement perturbation is done in one of two ways: physical-driven or logic-driven. For each extracted tree, the physical-driven perturbation changes the location of gates using a Pareto optimization approach. Also, each solution is evaluated by its wire-length overhead and a perturbation metric that discerns the placement difference from the original layout. According to , geometric-based difference alone may be insufficient to enhance the split circuit security. Thus, a logic-driven perturbation is performed with a weighted logical difference (WLD) metric, which encourages perturbation solutions with large logical difference from its neighbors. The authors assessed their techniques combining the gate selection and perturbation as BEOL+Physical, Logic+Physical and Logic+Logic, using ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 and ITC\\textquotesingle99 circuit benchmarks. Results for the smallest and largest circuits considered are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res}.\nA considerably different approach is proposed by Patnaik \\etal , whereas netlist modifications are promoted (instead of placement/routing modifications during physical synthesis). The goal is to modify the netlist of a design in order to insert (partial) randomization. According to , this approach helps to retain the misleading modifications throughout any regular design flow, thereby obtaining more resilient FEOL layouts where the netlist changes are later ``corrected'' in the BEOL. This methodology is implemented as an extension to commercial EDA tools with custom in-house scripts. The process goes as follows: first, the netlist is randomized. Second, the modified netlist is place and routed. Lastly, the true functionality is restored by re-routing in the BEOL. For the netlist randomization, pairs of drivers and their sinks are randomly selected and swapped. This is done in such way to avoid combinational loops that may be introduced by swapping. The modified netlist then is place and routed, utilizing a `do not touch'\\footnote{This terminology is used in IC design to mean that a specific cell or family of cells should not be optimized, i.e., not to be touched.} setting for the swapped drivers/sinks to avoid logic restructuring/removal of the related nets. Finally, the true connectivity is restored in the BEOL with the help of correction cells  that resemble switch boxes. The technique is evaluated using ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 circuits, and the results for the largest and smallest circuit are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res}.", "cites": [7798, 7799], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2857142857142857, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section integrates several cited papers to present a coherent narrative on proximity perturbation as a defense mechanism against split manufacturing attacks.

Since attacks mainly rely on hints left by EDA tools to recover the missing BEOL connections, the amount of hidden information is related to the circuit performance -- splitting the circuits at low metal layers increases the security level. Following the same idea, wire lifting proposes `lifting' wires from the FEOL layer to the BEOL. That is, changing the routing to split metal layers has the potential to increase the security level. \n  \\begin{table*}[htb]\n    \\rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}\n    \\centering\n     \\caption{Results for Defense Techniques based on Wire Lifting.}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cp{1cm}p{1.5cm}p{2.5cm}llp{1cm}p{1.5cm}p{1.5cm}}\n    \\hline \\hline \\\\ [-1.5ex]\n       \\textbf{Work} & \\textbf{Attack Type} & \\textbf{Benchmark} & \\textbf{Defense Technique} & \\textbf{Defense Metric} & \\textbf{Defense Overhead} & \\textbf{Split Layer} & \\textbf{Result without Defense} & \\textbf{Result with Defense} \\vspace{5pt}\\\\\n       \\hline\n     & SAT & c432 & Wire Lifting & \\textit{k-security} & 477\\% of WLO & -* & k=1 & k=48 \\\\\n     & Proximity & Superblue 1 & Routing Blockage Insertion & $E[LS]$ & Not Presented & M4 &  1.51 &  1.77 \\\\\n     & Proximity & Superblue 1 & Routing Blockage Insertion & $FOM$ & Not Presented & M4 & 1222.8 &  1433 \\\\\n     & Proximity & c432 & Concerted Lifting & Hamming Distance & 7.7\\% of Area & Average** & 23.4 & 45.9 \\\\\n     & Proximity & c432 & Concerted Lifting & CCR & 13.2\\% of Power & Average** & 92.4 & 0 \\\\\n     & Proximity & c7552 & Concerted Lifting & Hamming Distance & 16.7\\% of Area & Average** & 1.6 & 25.7 \\\\\n     & Proximity & c7552 & Concerted Lifting & CCR & 9.3\\% of Power & Average** & 97.8 & 0 \\\\\n     & Proximity & c2670 & CMP-Friendly & Hamming Distance & 3.4\\% of WLO & -* & 14.5\\% & 20.4\\% \\\\\n     & Proximity & c2670 & CMP-Friendly & CCR(\\%) & 3.4\\% of WLO & -* & 48.1\\% & 33.4\\% \\\\\n     & Proximity & b18 & CMP-Friendly & Hamming Distance & 0.4\\% of WLO & -* & 21.6\\% & 27.6\\% \\\\\n     & Proximity & b18 & CMP-Friendly & CCR(\\%) & 0.4\\% of WLO & -* & 12.1\\% & 10.7\\% \\\\\n     & Proximity & c2670 & SADP-Compliant & Hamming Distance & 7.49\\% of WLO & -* & 14.5\\% & 24.4\\% \\\\\n     & Proximity & c2670 & SADP-Compliant & CCR(\\%) & 7.49\\% of WLO & -* & 48.1\\% & 6.4\\% \\\\\n     & Proximity & b18 & SADP-Compliant & Hamming Distance & 4.64\\% of WLO & -* & 21.6\\% & 29.6\\% \\\\\n     & Proximity & b18 & SADP-Compliant & CCR(\\%) & 4.64\\% of WLO & -* & 12.1\\% & 2.7\\% \\\\ \\hline\n     & Proximity &  s526 & Net Partitioning & CCR(\\%) & Not Presented & -* & 40\\%*** & 0\\%*** \\\\\n     & Proximity &  s526 & Net Partitioning \\& Cell Hiding & CCR(\\%) & Not Presented & -* & 40\\%*** & 0\\%*** \\\\\n      & Proximity &  s526 & Net Partitioning \\& Cell Hiding \\& Pin Shaking & CCR(\\%) & Not Presented & -* & 40\\%*** & 0\\%*** \\\\\n     & Proximity &  s9234.1 & Net Partitioning & CCR(\\%) & Not Presented & -* & 30\\%*** & 4\\%*** \\\\\n     & Proximity &  s9234.1 & Net Partitioning \\& Cell Hiding & CCR(\\%) & Not Presented & -* & 30\\%*** & 1.5\\%*** \\\\\n      & Proximity &  s9234.1 & Net Partitioning \\& Cell Hiding \\& Pin Shaking & CCR(\\%) & Not Presented & -* & 30\\%***& 1.5\\%*** \\\\\n         \\hline    \n         \\hline\n         \\multicolumn{9}{l}{\\cellcolor{white}* Split layer not specified by the authors.} \\\\\n          \\multicolumn{9}{l}{\\cellcolor{white}** Results are given as an average between M3, M4, and M5.} \\\\\n          \\multicolumn{9}{l}{\\cellcolor{white}*** These results cannot be directly compared with previous ones as the transistor technology is vastly different.} \n         \\end{tabular}\n    \\label{tab:def_res2}\n\\end{table*} \nWire lifting was first presented by Imerson \\etal  where Split Manufacturing is considered as a 3D IC implementation . For the sake of argument, we will continue to refer to this technique as Split Manufacturing, even if the notion of untrusted FEOL vs. trusted BEOL is shifted. This type of 3D implementation consists of two or more independently manufactured ICs, where each IC represents a tier that is vertically integrated on top of each other. Connections between the tiers are done using vertical metal pillars, referred to as through-silicon vias (TSVs). In , a 3D implementation consisting of two tiers is used for their experiments. The bottom tier containing the transistors and some routing wires (akin to the FEOL), and the top tier, containing only routing wires (akin to the BEOL). Regarding the manufacturing of these 3D ICs, the bottom tier is built in a high-end untrusted foundry, and the top tier is built in an also untrusted foundry (not necessarily high-end, however).\nIn , threat model II is used, i.e., the adversary is assumed to possess the entire netlist. The problem is formulated as the attacker being the FEOL foundry, which in turn also possesses the so called `unlifted netlist' extracted from the FEOL layout. By utilizing a graph to represent the circuits as previously described, the attacker seeks a bijective mapping of gates of the unlifted netlist to gates in the complete netlist. According to , if the attacker can distinguish any gate between the two netlists, the split circuit does not provide any security. A security notion is provided by the authors, based on existing multiple mapping between gates in the unlifted and complete netlists. Referred to as \\textit{k-security}, this metric qualifies that gates across the design are indistinguishable from at least $k-1$ other gates. Thus, a defender wants to lift wires in a way to guarantee the higher $k-security$ possible. Two procedures are proposed to achieve this goal, one utilizing a greedy heuristic targeted at small circuits (due to scalability issues), and another procedure that utilizes partitioning to solve those issues. For their experimental study, they have utilized the ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 benchmark suite and a DES crypto circuit with approximated 35000 gates. The results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res2}, where $k=1$ is the original circuit and $k=48$ is achieved when all the wires are lifted. It is worth to mention that; besides the notion of the security metric, their defense technique was not validated using an actual proximity attack towards the modified netlist.\nAn artificial routing blockage\\footnote{This terminology is used in IC design to mean that a specific area should be avoided by the EDA tool for a specific task. A blockage can be for placement and/or for routing.} insertion that promotes wire lifting is proposed by Maga\\~na \\etal . The goal of this technique is to deceive proximity attacks by wire lifting. As discussed before, the objective of commercial EDA tools is to guarantee the best PPA possible. During the routing stage, lower metals are preferred for signal routing, promoting better PPA. Thus, routing blockages can be inserted at the split layer, forcing signals to be routed above the split layer. The result is an artificial wire lifting done during the routing stage. \nApplying this type of procedure must be done considering the design routability and overhead introduced, as well as top level floorplan decisions for the power grid, clock distribution, and resources for busses. Larger designs are generally difficult to be routed -- simply reducing the number of routing layers can make the design unroutable. In , a procedure is proposed to insert routing blockages ensuring the design routability is kept. After a first routing stage, the design is divided into small rectangular non-overlapping windows. The routing congestion is then analyzed in each window at the split layer for the blockage insertion. If the area has capacity for more routing, a routing blockage is inserted, otherwise the original routing is kept. Utilizing ISPD\\textquotesingle11 circuits, the technique is evaluated using the proximity attack proposed by , and its effectiveness is measured using two metrics, $E[LS]$ and $FOM$. The $E[LS]$ metric reports the candidate list size, being an average over different search areas. The $FOM$ metric is a figure of merit obtained from the ratio of candidates list size divided by the search area, when averaged over all the search areas at the split layer. According to , a higher value of $FOM$ means it is more challenging for an attack to be mounted because of the density of candidates (over the same search area). The results for the \\textit{Superblue 1} circuit are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res2}.\nDesign for Manufacturability (DFM) has become an extremely important aspect of IC design for many years now. Manufacturing an IC is a sensitive process that involves many critical steps. Hence, a layout is required to be compliant to several rules to ensure its manufacturability. A layout is said to be manufacturable if there are no DRC violations. However, for a design to also achieve high yield, the layout must also pass strict DFM checks. The most common checks are related to wire and via density over predetermined region sizes. Until now, defense techniques discussed were mainly concerned about security and PPA overheads. Feng \\etal  argued that previous works have largely neglected manufacturability concerns. Therefore, they proposed two wire-lifting techniques that address two important DFM-related techniques: Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) . The first technique, CMP-friendly routing defense is divided into layer elevation, wire selection, and re-routing. Layer elevation selects wires for lifting according to following principles :\n      \\begin{itemize}\n          \\item The wire has a significant logic difference from its neighboring wires. As such, an incorrect connection in attacking this wire may lead to more signal differences.\n          \\item The wire has large observability such that an erroneous guess by the adversary can easily affect the circuit primary output signals.\n          \\item The wire segment is originally at a wire-dense region. The wire density of this region would be reduced by the layer elevation and makes the corresponding FEOL layer have more uniform wire density.\n          \\item The BEOL region where the wire is elevated to has low wire density so that the density of the corresponding BEOL layer is more uniform.\n      \\end{itemize}\nPrinciples 1 and 2 have the goal to increase security in the same way as described in . After the wire lifting step, a set of wires is selected for re-routing. The selection has two purposes, CMP-friendliness and security improvement. For CMP-friendliness, wires located in dense regions are selected to be re-rerouted in sparse areas. For the security improvement, decoys are inserted if the routing detour passes through a sparse area. A suspicious attacker may realize that the detour is a defense measure. After selecting the set of wires to be re-routed, wires are re-routed one at a time. According to , their routing approach considers wire density, while the routing perturbation proposed by  can be solely focused on security, and may not be CMP-friendly. Utilizing a graph representation, their re-routing method is based on the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm  where the density of wires is used as a metric. \nWith a few exceptions, the SADP-compliant routing defense follows the same approach as described above. During wire lifting, the density is not considered. Wire re-routing is actually wire extension of FEOL wires as in . This wire extension of FEOL wires inevitably leads to re-routing of connected BEOL wires. According to , solving SADP violations by wire extension can also increase security, as its increase the distance between vias. The wire extension for simultaneous SADP-compliance and security is realized using Integer Linear Programming. In their experiments, ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 and ISPD\\textquotesingle11 are used to evaluate their techniques. Each technique, CMP-friendly and SADP-compliant routing, is evaluated separately. The results for the smallest and largest circuits are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res2}.\nWire lifting approaches, in general, are not cost-free. As shown in the discussed results, wire-lifting based defenses introduce a considerable PPA overhead. An approach to establish a cost-security trade-off is proposed by Paitinak \\etal , i.e., PPA margins for a given security budget. In , a concerted wire-lifting method is proposed. The authors claim to enable higher degrees of security while being cost-effective. For their method, custom elevating cells are used for executing the wire-lifting. Elevating cells connect gates or short wires directly to the first layer above the split layer. Their wire-lifting method utilizes three strategies: lifting high-fanout nets, controlling the distance for open pin pairs, and obfuscation of short nets. High-fanout nets are chosen to be lifted for two reasons: (a) a wrong connection made by the attacker propagates the error to multiple locations, and, (b) introduces multiple open pin pairs. As the attack to overcome is the proximity one, controlling the distance between open pin pairs is necessary, which is achieved at will simply by controlling the placement of the elevating cells. According to , short nets may be easy for an attacker to identify and localize (from assessing driving strengths). Short wires are obfuscated by inserting an elevating cell with two pins close to each other, one being the true connection and the other a dummy connection. Finally, wires are lifted according to those strategies until a given PPA budget is reached. For their experimental study, ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 and ISPD\\textquotesingle11 circuits are utilized. However, results for attacks are presented only for ISCAS\\textquotesingle85 circuits. For ISPD\\textquotesingle11, only the PPA impact result introduced by their technique is presented. Once again, we present the results for the smallest and largest of the studied circuits in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res2}.\nWhile the majority of studies reported in our survey make use of conventional transistors (bulk CMOS technologies with either planar or FinFET transistors), Yang \\etal  proposed a design methodology to secure Split Manufacturing for Vertical Slit Field Effect Transistor (VeSFET)-based integrated circuits. VeSFET is a twin-gate device with a horizontal channel and four metal pillars implementing vertical terminals . While a detailed explanation on VeSFETs is beyond the scope of this work, we do highlight the differences between VesFETs and conventional transistors. In contrast with conventional transistors, a VeSFET can be accessed by both top and bottom pillars, allowing two-side routing and offering a friendly monolithic 3D integration . While we have so far considered ICs that have two distinct layers, the FEOL and BEOL, a VeSFET-based IC has tiers of the layer containing the transistors. Connections between tiers can be made directly, same as TSV by the pillars, or by a layer containing connections between tiers. A 2D VeSFET design contains only one tier and both top and bottom connections, whereas a 3D design contains two or more tiers. In summary, the notion of tier is pushed down to the transistor level in this device topology, thus making it an interesting platform for Split Manufacturing.\nThe method proposed by  assumes that both foundries are untrusted and have the same capability (i.e., same technology). For 2D designs, the first foundry manufactures the tier with the top connections, comprising most of the connections. Then, the rest of the bottom connections, comprising of the critical minority connections, are completed by the second foundry. For 3D IC designs, they proposed special types of standard cells, referred as cell A and B. Cell A has two tiers that are visible and manufactured by the first foundry, as well as inter-tier connections. Cell B has only the top tier visible and manufactured by the first foundry, the low tier is completed by the second foundry, without inter-tier connections. Thus, transistors can be hidden from the first foundry as a security feature. Vulnerabilities claimed by  for both 2D and 3D methods are described in Table~\\ref{tab:vesfet_vul}. Practices of reverse engineering and IC overbuilding are claimed to be impossible because the first foundry controls the number of wafers available to the second foundry.\nIncreasing the security of both 2D and 3D VesFET designs is achieved by net partitioning, and exclusively for 3D designs, by transistor hiding and pin shacking. Net partitioning is performed similarly to the wire lifting techniques described above, where nets are chosen to be routed in the bottom connection layer, thus, hiding those from the first foundry. Their selection method is done by selecting nets from sequential logic. First, all the high-fanout nets are selected to be partitioned. Next, the remaining nets are selected by a search area, where two approaches are used, distance-first search and high-fanout first search. In distance-first method, a pin in a predefined search window connecting to an un-partitioned net is selected when it has the minimum distance to the currently processed pin pair. The FO-first search method selects the pin connecting to a net having the highest FO in the searching window. Transistor hiding in 3D designs is done by utilizing cells similar to the cell B. Cells connected only by partitioned nets are candidates for hiding. After selecting the candidates, availability of unused transistors that are accessible to the second foundry in the lower tiers of the nearby cells is checked. If the available transistor count is sufficient, then the cell is hidden. The empty space created could provide clues for the first foundry about the security technique. Pin shaking is then applied to obfuscate the empty spaces. Some nearby cells are moved to this area to obfuscate the layout for any distance-based proximity attackers. In , 10 MCNC LGSynth\\textquotesingle91 benchmark circuits are used to evaluate the effectiveness of their methodology. The best and worst results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:def_res2}. It is worth to mention that, even though the VesFET implementation mimics the layered structure of Split Manufacturing, the results cannot be compared side by side in a fair manner.\n    \\begin{table}[htb]\n    \\rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}\n       \\centering\n       \\caption{Vulnerabilities of Split Manufactured VesFET-based Designs Described by .}\n       \\begin{tabular}{lll}\n       \\hline \\hline \\\\ [-1.5ex]\n          \\textbf{Threats}  & \\textbf{1st Foundry} & \\textbf{2nd Foundry} \\vspace{5pt} \\\\\n        \\hline\n         \\parbox{1cm}{Design\\\\ Reconstruction}   & \\parbox{2.5cm}{2D IC: Very Difficult \\\\ 3D IC: Impossible} & \\parbox{2cm}{Impossible due to a very limited\\\\ information} \\\\\n         Trojan Insertion        & \\parbox{2.5cm}{Possible, but will be\\\\ detected}  & \\parbox{2cm}{No control of devices} \\\\\n         \\parbox{1cm}{Reverse\\\\ Engineering}      &  Meaningless & Impossible\\\\\n         IC Overbuilding           & Meaningless  & Impossible \\\\\n         \\hline\n         \\hline\n       \\end{tabular}\n       \\label{tab:vesfet_vul}\n   \\end{table}", "cites": [7800], "cite_extract_rate": 0.07692307692307693, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "comparative", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple works on wire lifting techniques and presents a comparison of their defense metrics and overheads.
