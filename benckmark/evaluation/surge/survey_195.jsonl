Therefore, enhancing the \\emph{generalization} ability of ML models is important in both industry and academic fields.\nThere are many generalization-related research topics such as domain adaptation, meta-learning, transfer learning, covariate shift, and so on.\nIn recent years, \\emph{Domain generalization (DG)} has received much attention.\nAs shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig-dg-example}, the goal of \\dg is to learn a model from one or several different but related domains (\\ieno, diverse training datasets) that will generalize well on \\emph{unseen} testing domains.\nFor instance, given a training set consisting of images coming from sketches, cartoon images and paintings, domain generalization requires to train a good machine learning model that has minimum prediction error in classifying images coming from natural images or photos, which are clearly having distinguished distributions from the images in training set.\nOver the past years, \\dg has made significant progress in various areas such as computer vision and natural language processing.\nDespite the progress, there has not been a survey in this area that comprehensively introduces and summarizes its main ideas, learning algorithms and other related problems to provide research insights for the future.\nIn this paper, we present the first survey on \\dg to introduce its recent advances, with special focus on its formulations, theories, algorithms, research areas, datasets, applications, and future research directions.\nWe hope that this survey can provide a comprehensive review for interested researchers and inspire more research in this and related areas.\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figures/fig-dg.pdf}\n    \\caption{Examples from the dataset PACS~ for \\dg.

And we also include more recent papers (over 30\\% of new work).\n    \\item We extend the scope of datasets and applications, and we also explore evaluation standards to domain generalization.

Causal relation gives information of how the system will behave under intervention, so it is naturally suitable for transfer learning tasks, since domain shift can be seen as an intervention.

There are a number of works~ that exploited causality for domain adaptation.\nFor domain generalization,  reweighted input samples in a way to make the weighted correlation reflect causal effect.  took Fourier features as the causing factors of images, and enforce the independence among these features. Using the additional data of object identity (it is a more detailed label than the class label),  enforced the conditional independence of the representation from domain index given the same object. When such object label is unavailable,  further learned an object feature based on labels in a separate stage.

Many works investigate DG on classification. Some works also study DG for semantic segmentation~, action recognition~, face anti-spoofing~, person Re-ID~, street view recognition~, video understanding~, and image compression~.\nMedical analysis~ is one of the important application areas for DG due to its nature of data scarcity and existence of domain gaps, with the tasks of tissue segmentation~, Parkinson's disease recognition~, activity recognition~, chest X-ray recognition~, and EEG-based seizure detection~. \nApart from those areas, DG is also useful in reinforcement learning of robot control~ to generalize to an unseen environment.\nSome work used DG to recognize speech utterance~, fault diagnosis~, physics~, brain-computer interface~.\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\resizebox{.5\\textwidth}{!}{\n\t\\input{figures/fig-application}\n\t}\n\t\\caption{Several applications of \\dg.}\n\t\\label{fig-app}\n\\end{figure}\nIn natural language processing, it is also common that training data comes from different domains with different distributions and DG techniques are helpful. \nSome work used \\dg for sentiment classification on the Amazon Review dataset~.\nOthers used DG for semantic parsing~, web page classification~. For instance, if we are given natural language data from multiple domains and want to learn a generalized model that predicts well on any new domain, we can use \\dg to acquire domain-invariant representations.\nMoreover, DG techniques favor broad prospects in some applications, such as financial analysis, weather prediction, and logistics.\nFor instance,  tried to adopt DG to time series modeling. They first propose the temporal covariate shift problem that widely exists in time series data, then, they proposed an RNN-based model to solve this problem to align the hidden representations between any pair of training data that are from different domains.\nTheir algorithm, the so-called AdaRNN, was applied to stock price prediction, weather prediction, and electric power consumption.\nAnother example is , where they applied domain generalization to sensor-based human activity recognition.\nIn their application, the activity data from different persons are from different distributions, resulting in severe model collapse when applied to new users.\nTo resolve such problem, they developed a variational autoencoder-based network to learn the domain-invariant and domain-specific modules, thus achieving the disentanglement.\nIn the future, we hope there can be more DG applications in other areas to tackle with the distributional shift that widely exists in different applications.\nAnother important problem is the evaluation of DG algorithms without accessing the test distribution in reality. While we can use the test data for evaluation in research, we simply cannot do it for real applications. In this case, one possible approach would be performing meta-train and meta-test split for the original data for multiple times. In each time, one split can be regarded as the unseen test data while the other as the training data. We can call it the meta-cross-validation for DG in reality. At the same time, we also hope there could be more evaluation metrics. For more evaluation in research, please refer to the next section.\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Eighteen popular datasets for \\dg.

We think this is probably because the task is relatively easy.\nFor the explicit distribution matching, more and more works tend to match the joint distributions rather than just match the marginal~ or conditional~ distributions.\nThus, it is more feasible to perform dynamic distribution matching~.\nBoth disentanglement and IRM methods have good motivations for generalization, while more efficient training strategy can be developed.\nThere are several studies  that pointed out merely learning domain-invariant features are insufficient and representation smoothness should also be considered.\nFor learning strategy, there is a trend that many works used meta-learning for DG, where it requires to design better optimization strategies to utilize the rich information of different domains.\nIn addition to deep networks, there are also some work~ that used random forest for DG, and we hope more diverse methods will come.", "cites": [2735, 8578, 2797, 2723], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4444444444444444, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section shows reasonable synthesis by connecting ideas from multiple cited works, especially in discussing data manipulation, distribution matching, and representation learning.
