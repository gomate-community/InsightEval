Meanwhile, in many practical applications, such as autonomous vehicles (Figure \\ref{fig:1} shows a point cloud collected by an autonomous vehicle), we need more information than only images to obtain a better sense of the environment. 3D data from lidar or RGB-D cameras are considered to be a good supplement here. These devices generate 3D geometric data in the form of point clouds. With the growing demand from industry, utilization of point clouds with deep learning models is becoming a research hotspot recently. \\par\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{pc1.png}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{pc2.png}\n\\end{center}\n   \\caption{Point cloud data collected from outdoor scene, shown from two distinct angles.}\n\\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure}\nIn constrast to image data, point clouds do not directly contain spatial structure, and deep models on point clouds must therefore solve three main problems: (1) how to find a representation of high information density from a sparse point cloud, (2) how to build a network satisfying necessary restrictions like size-variance and permutation-invariance, (3)  how to process large volumes of data with lower time and computing resource consumption. PointNet  is one of the representative early attempts to design a novel deep network for comsumption of unordered 3D point sets by taking advantage of MLP and T-Net. PointNet, together with its improved version PointNet++ , inspired a lot of follow-up works. \\par\nFundamental tasks in images, such as classification, segmentation and object detection also exist in point clouds. Most solutions to these problems benefit from research findings on the image side, while adequate adaptions are inevitable to suit the characteristics of 3D data. In this paper, recent works on point clouds are divided into the following categories: classification, segmentation, detection, matching and registration, augmentation, completion and reconstruction. Detailed descriptions of each category will be provided in the following sections. \\par\nA growing number of datasets are available for different tasks on point clouds. ShapeNet  and ModelNet  are two early datasets consisting of clean 3D models. These early datasets suffer from the lack of generalization. However, it is necessary to consider disturbance including noise and missing points to develop robust models. With that in mind, datasets such as ScanNet  and KITTI  are then created from scans of the actual environment. Datasets designed for autonomous vehicle tasks, like nuScenes  and Lyft , are further generalized by involving various environments at different times. Currently, ever more datasets are being proposed in order to meet the increasing demands of distinct niches. \\par\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces existing 3D datasets and corresponding metrics for different tasks. Section 3 includes a survey of 3D shape classification methods. Section 4 reviews methods for 3D semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Section 5 presents a survey of methods for 3D object detection and its derivative task. Section 6 introduces recent progress in 3D point cloud matching and registration. Section 7 provides a review of methods to improve data quality. Finally, section 8 concludes the paper. \\par", "cites": [1517, 7376, 7385, 7374], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The introduction provides a basic overview of the field, mentioning key challenges in point cloud processing and citing representative papers such as PointNet++ and datasets like nuScenes and ScanNet.

ShapeNetSem, which is one of the subsets, contains 12000 models spread over a broader set of 270 categories. This dataset, together with ModelNet40 , are relatively clean and small, so they are usually used to evaluate the capacity of backbones before applied to more complicated\ntasks.\\par\n\\textbf{ModelNet40} The ModelNet  project provides three benchmarks: ModelNet10, ModelNet40 and Aligned40. The ModelNet40 benchmark, where ``40\" indicates the number of classes, is the most widely used. To find the most common object categories, the statistics obtained from the SUN database  are utilized. After establishing the vocabulary, 3D CAD models are collected with online search engines and verified by human workers. \\par\n\\textbf{S3DIS} The Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces (S3DIS) dataset is composed of 5 large-scale indoor scenes from three buildings to hold diverse in architectural style and appearance. The point clouds are automatically generated without manual intervention. 12 semantic elements including structural elements (floor, wall, etc.) and common furniture are detected. \\par\n\\textbf{Semantic3D} Semantic3D  is the largest 3D point cloud dataset for outdoor scene segmentation so far. It contains over 4 billion points collected from around 110000$m^2$ area with a static lidar. The natural of outdoor scene, such as the unevenly distribution of points and massive occlusions, makes the dataset challenging. \\par\n\\textbf{ScanNet} ScanNet  is a video dataset consists of 2.5 million frames from more than 1000 scans, annotated with camera poses, surface reconstructions and instance-level semantic segmentation. The dataset provides benchmarks for mutiple 3D scene understanding tasks, such as classification, semantic voxel labeling and CAD model retrieval. \\par\n\\textbf{KITTI} The KITTI  vision benchmark suite is among the most famous benchmarks with 3D data. It covers benchmarks for 3D object detection, tracking and scene flow estimation. The multi-view data are captured with an autonomous driving platform with two high-resolution color and gray cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a GPS localization system.

Recently, the rising demand from industry of autonomous driving has spawned several large-scale road-based datasets, represented by nuScenes , Lyft Level 5  and Waymo Open Dataset .

A pairwise distance loss and centroid loss are introduced to feature learning based on the assumption that points with the same semantic label are supposed to be closer. PointWeb , as mentioned in classification, can also be adapted to predict segmentation labels. PVCNN  proposed a comprehensive method that leverages both point and voxel representation to obtain memory and computation efficiency simultaneously.\\par\nSome extensions of the convolution operator are introduced for feature extraction on point cloud. PCCN  introduces parametric continuous convolutional layers. These layers are parameterized by MLPs and span full continuous vector spaces. The generalization allows models to learn over any data structure where the support relationship is computable. Pointwise-CNN  introduced a point-wise convolution where the neighbor points are projected into kernel cells and convolved with corresponding kernel weights. Engelmann et al.  proposed Dilated Point Convolution (DPC) to aggregate dilated neighbor features, instead of the conventional k-nearest neighbors. \\par\nGraph networks are also used in some segmentation models to obtain the underlying geometric structures of the input point clouds. SPG  introduced a structure called superpoint graph (SPG) to capture the organization of point clouds. The idea is further extended in , which introduces a oversegmentation (into pure superpoints) of the input point cloud. Aside from that, Graph Attention Convolution  (GAC) is proposed to learn relevant features from local neighborhoods selectively. By dynamically assigning attention weights to different neighbor points and different feature channels based on their spatial positions and feature differences, the model is able to learn discriminative features from the most relevant part of the neighbor point sets.\\par\nCompared with projection-based methods, point-based methods usually require more computation and therefore have more trouble dealing with large-scale data. Tatarchenko et al.  introduced tangent convolutions to solve this. A fully-convolutional network is designed based on the tangent convolution and successfully improved the performance on large-scale point clouds. RandLA-Net  attempted to reduce computation by replace conventional complex point sampling approaches with random sampling. And to avoid random sampling from discarding crucial information, a novel feature aggregation module is introduced to enlarge receptive fields of each point. \\par\nBased on the fact that the production of point-level labels is labor-intensive and time-consuming, some methods explored weakly supervised segmentation. Xu and Lee  proposed a weakly supervised approach which only requires a small fraction of points to be labelled at training stage.

Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN)  is a representative work that learns a feature and semantic map for each point, and a similarity matrix to estimate the similarity between pairs of features. A heuristic non-maximal suppression method follows to merge points into instances. Lahoud et al.  adopted multi-task metric learning to (1) learn a feature embedding such that voxels with the same instance label are close and those with different labels are separated in the feature space and (2) predict the shape of instance at each voxel. Instance boundaries are estimated with mean-shift clustering and NMS. \\par\nZhang et al.  introduced a probabilistic embedding to encode point clouds. The embedding is implemented with multivariate\nGaussian distribution, and the Bhattacharyya kernel is adopted to esimate the similarity between points. Proposal-free methods do not suffer from the computational complexity of region-proposal layers; however, it is usually difficult for them to produce discriminative object boundaries from clustering. \\par\nThere are also several instance segmentation methods based on projection. SqueezeSeg  is one of the pioneer works in this direction. In this method, points are first projected onto a sphere for a grid-based representation. The transformed representation is of size $H\\times W\\times C$, where in practice $H$=64 is the number of vertical channels of lidar, $W$ is manually picked to be 512, and $C$ equals to 5 (3 dimensional coordinates + intensity measurement + range). The representation is then fed through a conventional 2D CNN and a conditional random field (CRF) for refined segmentation results. This method is afterwards improved by SqueezeSegv2  with a context aggregation module and a domain adaptation pipeline. \\par\nThe idea of projection-based methods is further explored by Lyu et al. . Inspired by graph drawing algorithms, they proposed a hierarchical approximate algorithm to project point clouds into image representations with abundant local geometric information preserved. The segmentation will then be generated by a multi-scale U-Net from the image representation. With this innovative projection algorithm, the method obtained significant improvement. \\par\nPointGroup  proposed a bottom-up framework with two prediction branches. For each point, its semantic label and relative offset to its respective instance centroid are predicted. The offset branch helps better grouping of points into objects as well as separation of objects with the same semantic label. During the clustering stage, both original positions and shifted positions are considered, the association of these two results turns out to have a better performance.

In addition to the regular regression branch, STD has another IoU branch to replace the role of classification score in NMS.\\par\nSome methods use foreground-background classification to improve the quality of proposals. PointRCNN  is such a framework, in which points are directly segmented to screen out foreground points, while semantic features and spatial features are then fused to produce high-quality 3D boxes.

A group of points are sampled as seeds, and each seed independently generates a vote for potential center points of objects in the point cloud with the help of PointNet++ . By taking advantage of voting, VoteNet outperforms previous approaches on two large indoor benchmarks. However, as the center point prediction of virtual center points is not as stable, the method performs less satisfactorily in wild scenes. As a follow-up work, ImVoteNet  inherited the idea of VoteNet and achieved prominent improvement by fusing 3D votes with 2D votes from images.\\par\nThere are also attempts that consider domain knowledge as an auxiliary to enhance features. Associate-3Ddet  introduced the idea of perceptual-to-conceptual association. To enrich perception features that might be incomplete due to occlusion or sparsity, a perceptual-to-conceptual module is proposed to generate class-wise conceptual models from the dataset.

In this case, removing upsampling layers could lead to huge performance drop. 3DSSD proposed F-FPS, a new sampling strategy based on feature distances, to preserve more foreground points for instances. The fusion of F-FPS and D-FPS, together with the candidate generation layer and 3D center-ness assignment in the prediction head, help this method outperform previous single-stage methods with a considerable margin. \\par\nGraph neural networks have also been introduced to 3D object detection for its ability to accommodate intrinsic characteristics of point clouds like sparsity. PointRGCN  is an early work that introduce graph-based representation for 3D vehicle detection refinement. After that, HGNet  introduces a hierarchical graph network based on shape-attentive graph convolution (SA-GConv). By capturing object shapes with relative geometric information and reasoning on proposals, the method obtained a significant improvement on previous results. Besides, Point-GNN  proposed a single-shot method based on graph neural networks. It first builds a fixed radius near-neighbors graph over the input point cloud. Then, the category and the bounding box of affiliation are predicted with the point graph. Finally, a box merging and scoring operation is used to obtain accurate combination of detection results from multiple vertices. \\par", "cites": [7414, 5602, 7404, 7407, 7418, 7405, 7411, 7385], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8, "origin_cites_number": 10, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes key point-based object detection methods by highlighting common themes like minimizing information loss and using voting or graph-based strategies.

In this approach, candidate boxes are generated from BEV map and projected into feature maps of multiple views (RGB images, lidar data, etc.), then the region-wise features extracted from different views are combined to produce the final oriented 3D bounding boxes. While this approach achieves satisfactory performance, much like many other early multi-view methods, its running speed is too slow for practical use. \\par\nAttempts to improve multi-view methods generally take one of two directions. First, we could find a more efficient way to fuse information from different views. Liang et al.  use continuous convolutions to effectively fuse feature maps from images and lidar at different resolutions. Image features for each point in BEV space are utilized to generate a dense BEV feature map by bi-linear interpolation with projections of image features within the BEV plane. Experiments show that dense BEV feature maps perform better than discrete image feature maps and sparse point cloud feature maps. Second, many methods propose innovative feature extraction approaches to obtain representations of input data with higher robustness. SCANet  introduced a Spatial Channel Attention (SCA) module to make use of multi-scale contextual information. The SCA module captures useful features from the global and multi-scale context of given scene, while an Extension Spatial Unsample (ESU) module helps combine multi-scale low-level features to generate high-level features with rich spatial information, which then leads to accurate 3D object proposals. In RT3D , the majority of convolution operations prior to the RoI pooling module are removed. With such optimization, RoI convolutions only need to be performed once for all proposals, accelerating the method to run at 11.1 FPS, which is five times faster than MV3D . \\par\nAnother approach to detect 3D objects is to generate candidate regions on 2D plane with 2D object detectors, then extract a 3D frustum proposal for each 2D candidate region. In F-PointNets , each 2D region generates a frustum proposal, and the features of each 3D frustum are learned with PointNet  or PointNet++  and used for 3D bounding box estimation. PointFusion  uses both 2D image region and corresponding frustum points for more accurate 3D box regression. A fusion network is proposed to directly predict corner locations of boxes by fusing image features and global features from point clouds. \\par", "cites": [7385], "cite_extract_rate": 0.125, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple multi-view detection methods, highlighting their shared goals and architectural differences.

However, such an idea cannot be directly extended to point clouds because there are multiple formats of noise in point clouds, such as a global position deviation where no reliable reference point exists.

While typical applications of point cloud models, such as autonomous driving, consider safety as a critical concern, it is helpful to study how current deep neural networks on point clouds are affected by false samples.\\par\nXiang et al.  proposed several algorithms to generate adversarial point clouds against PointNet. The adversarial algorithms work in two ways: point perturbation and point generation. Perturbation is implemented by shifting existing points negligibly, and generation is implemented by either adding some independent and scattered points or a small number of point clusters with predefined shapes. Shu et al.  proposed tree-GAN, a tree-structured graph convolution network. By performing graph convolution within a tree, the model takes advantage of ancestor information to enrich the capacity of features. Along with the development of adversarial networks, DUP-Net  is proposed to defend 3D adversarial models. The model contains a statistical outlier removal (SOR) module as denoiser and a data-driven upsampling network as upsampler. \\par\nAside from adversarial generation, generative models are also used for point cloud upsampling. There are generally two motivations to upsample a point cloud. The first is to reduce the sparseness and irregularity of data, and the second is to restore missing points due to occlusion. \\par\nFor the first aim, PU-Net  proposed upsampling in the feature space. For each point, multi-level features are extracted and expanded via a multi-branch convolution unit; after that, the expanded feature is split into multiple features and reconstructed to upsample the input set. Inspired by image super-resolution models, Wang et al.  proposed a cascade of patch-based upsampling networks, learning different levels of details at different steps, where at each step the network focuses only on a local patch from the output of the previous step. The architecture is able to upsample a sparse input point set to a dense set with rich details. Hui et al.  also proposed a learning-based deconvolution network that generates multi-resolution point clouds based on low-resolution input with bilateral interpolation performed in both the spatial and feature spaces.\\par\nMeanwhile, early methods in completion, such as , tend to voxelize the input point cloud at the very beginning. PCN  was the first framework to work on raw point clouds and in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Wang et al.  improved the results with a two-step reconstruction design.

More generally, PU-GAN  proposed a data-driven generative adversarial network to learn point distributions from the data and upsample points over patches on the surfaces of objects. Furthermore, RL-GAN-Net  uses a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to provide fast and reliable control of a generative adversarial network. By first training the GAN on the dimension-reduced latent space representation, and then finding the correct input to generate the representation that fits the current input form the uncompleted point cloud with a RL agent, the framework is able to convert noisy, partial point cloud into a completed shape in real time.\\par", "cites": [5611, 5612, 5607, 5609, 5613, 5610, 5608, 7968, 7967], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6428571428571429, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes generative methods for point cloud augmentation and completion effectively, grouping works by their aims (e.g., reducing sparseness vs. completing missing parts) and highlighting architectural innovations such as feature space upsampling, cascaded refinement, and gridding-based approaches.
