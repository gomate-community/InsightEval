However, there are open issues and challenges which still need to be addressed in securing the IoT . Thus, the IoT systems are compromised with security issues and are vulnerable to many attacks. In this section, we examine the security issues at each layer of the IoT protocol stack and identify corresponding threats and attacks that can manifest at each layer. Some of the security issues/attacks in the layered IoT architecture are classified in the Table \\ref{list}.\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{list of security challenges, issues/attacks in existing IoT systems\\label{list}}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{2cm} p{9.8cm} p{3.3cm} }  \n\\toprule\n\\textbf{IoT \\newline Layers} & \\textbf{Security Issues/ attacks}   & \\textbf{Security  Parameters} \\\\\n\\midrule\nApplication Layer & Data access and security authentication issues, Data Protection and Recovery problems, spear-phishing attack, Software Vulnerabilities,  Attacks on Reliability and Clone attack  \\newline & Data privacy, \\newline Access Control \\\\ \nMiddleware Layer & making intelligent decision processing huge data, malicious-code attacks, multi-party authentication, handling suspicious information  \\newline & Integrity, \\newline Confidentiality \\\\ \nNetwork Layer & Cluster security problems, DoS attacks, Spoofed, Altered or Replayed routing Information     \\newline & Authentication, \\newline Integrity \\\\ \nPerception Layer & Node capture, Fake node, Mass node authentication, Cryptographic Algorithm and Key Management Mechanism  & Integrity,\\newline Authentication, \\newline Confidentiality \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\\end{center}", "cites": [8402], "cite_extract_rate": 0.125, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of security issues in each layer of the IoT architecture, listing threats and attacks without substantial integration or synthesis of ideas from the cited paper.

The core security issues in this layer are related to authentication and integrity of the data that are being transmitted in the network. Despite the relatively better security protection in the network layer, it is still vulnerable to counterfeit attack and Man-in-the-Middle attack . The most common attacks that occur in the network layer are as follows:\n\\textbf{Replay attacks:} \nIn replay attacks, an intruder copies a fragment or key of the messages that are being exchanged between the two parties and steals the information. The authenticated information is then re-transmitted maliciously to the receiver for an evil purpose, such as duplicate transactions . The authenticated message is sent again and again and the receiver processes the request believing it as a legitimate messages that meets the desire of the intruder.\n\\textbf{Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:}\nDenial of Service (DoS) is a kind of attack in which the legitimate user is prevented from accessing the emails, websites, data or network services. It is a situation in which the attackers attempt to flood the network with unwanted traffic, malicious codes and actions that weakens the network's potential to provide the programmed service . \n\\textbf{Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:}\nIn man-in-the-middle attack, an intruder intervenes in a communication between two parties, either to eavesdrop or to impersonate both parties and gains access to information of the communicating parties. The motive of the attack is to steal personal information, alter the message or data that are believed to be received from the trusted parties . For instance, the recorded temperature by a sensor in IoT can be altered intentionally by the attacker to overheat the device, which lead to the failure of the working device.\n\\textbf{Malicious Code Injection:}\nIn malicious code injection, an attacker captures a working node and injects it with malicious-codes to gain access and control of the network. Sometimes it could also lead to the shutdown of the network .\n\\textbf{Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):}\nA DDoS attack is a DoS attack in which a node is targeted by multiple compromised node by flooding the network with useless messages and malicious codes causing the unavailability of the service for the targeted users. The targeted networks are forced to slow down and often shut down leading to denial of service to the legitimate users.", "cites": [8402], "cite_extract_rate": 0.16666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 1.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of common network layer attacks in IoT but lacks meaningful synthesis of ideas from the cited paper.
