SOD plays a key role in a range of real-world applications, such as stereo matching~, \nimage understanding , co-saliency detection~, action recognition , video detection and segmentation , semantic segmentation , medical image segmentation~, object tracking , person re-identification , camouflaged object detection~, image retrieval~, \\etc. Although significant progress has been made in the SOD field over the past several years , there is still room for improvement when faced with challenging factors, such as complicated background or different lighting conditions in the scenes. One way to overcome these challenges is to employ depth maps, which provide complementary spatial information for RGB images and have become easier to capture due to the large availability of depth sensors (\\eg, Microsoft Kinect).\nRecently, RGB-D based SOD has gained increasing attention and various methods have been developed . Early RGB-D based SOD models tended to extract handcrafted features and then fuse RGB image and depth maps. For example, Lang \\etal~, the first work on RGB-D based SOD, utilized Gaussian mixture models to model the distribution of depth-induced saliency. Ciptadi \\etal~ extracted 3D layout and shape features from depth measurements. Besides, several methods  measure depth contrast using the depth difference between different regions. In , a multi-contextual contrast model including local, global, and background contrast was developed to detect salient objects using depth maps. More importantly, however, this work also provided the first large-scale RGB-D dataset for SOD. Despite the effectiveness achieved by traditional methods using handcrafted features, they tend to suffer from a limited generalization ability for low-level features and lack the high-level reasoning required for complex scenes. To address these limitations, several deep learning-based RGB-D SOD methods  have been developed, showing improved performance. DF  was the first model to introduce deep learning technology into the RGB-D based SOD task. More recently, various deep learning-based models  have focused on exploiting effective multi-modal correlations and multi-scale/level information to boost SOD performance. To more clearly describe the progress in the RGB-D based SOD field, we provide a brief chronology in Fig.~\\ref{fig_0}. \n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{overpic}[width=0.99\\linewidth]{Fig2.pdf}\n\\put(7.7,23.7){\\footnotesize }  \n\\put(15.2,27.7){\\footnotesize }  \n\\put(21.3,33.2){\\footnotesize }      \n\\put(25.8,6.6){\\footnotesize }        \n\\put(31.1,29.9){\\footnotesize } \n\\put(41.7,25.0){\\footnotesize }     \n\\put(51.7,31.9){\\footnotesize }        \n\\put(62.4,9.0){\\footnotesize }        \n\\put(72.8,25.3){\\footnotesize }  \n\\put(74.6,34.4){\\footnotesize }     \n\\put(76.6,3.4){\\footnotesize }      \n\\put(83.4,29.3){\\footnotesize }       \n\\put(86.9,9.3){\\footnotesize }           \n\\put(89.0,24.9){\\footnotesize }           \n\\end{overpic}\\vspace{-0.25cm}\n\\caption{ A brief chronology of RGB-D based SOD.

(1) \\textbf{Traditional/deep models}: they are viewed from the perspective of feature extraction, that is using the manual features or  deep features. It is convenient for follow-up researchers to grasp the historical development trends of RGB-D SOD models. (2) \\textbf{Fusion-wise models}: it is critical to effectively fuse RGB and depth images in this task, thus we review different fusion strategies to understand their effectiveness. (3) \\textbf{Single-stream/multi-stream models}: we consider this problem from the perspective of model parameters. Single stream can save parameters, but the final result may not be optimal, and multiple streams may require more parameters. Thus, it is helpful to understand the balance between the amount of calculation and accuracy of different models. (4) \\textbf{Attention-aware models}: attention mechanisms have widely been applied in various visual tasks including SOD. We review related works on RGB-D SOD to analyze how do different models use attention. Thus, it is an alternative to design attention modules for future works. \n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.0}\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Summary of RGB-D based SOD methods

With depth cues, several useful attributes, such as boundary cues, shape attributes, surface normals, etc., can be explored to boost the identification of salient objects in complex scenes. Over the past several years, many traditional RGB-D models based on handcrafted features have been developed . For example, the early work  focused on modeling the interaction between layout and shape features generated from the RGB image and depth map. Besides, the representative work  developed a novel multi-stage RGB-D model, and constructed the first large-scale RGB-D benchmark dataset, termed NLPR. \n\\textbf{Deep Models}. However, the above-mentioned methods suffer from unsatisfactory SOD performance due to the limited expression ability of handcrafted features. To address this, several studies have turned to deep neural networks (DNNs) to fuse RGB-D data . These models can learn high-level representations to explore complex correlations across RGB images and depth cues for improving SOD performance. We review some representative works in detail as follows.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{DF}  develops a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to integrate different low-level saliency cues into hierarchical features, for effectively locating salient regions in RGB-D images. This was the first CNN-based model for the RGB-D SOD task. However, it utilizes a shallow architecture to learn the saliency map. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{PCF}  presents a complementarity-aware fusion module to integrate cross-modal and cross-level feature representations. It can effectively exploit complementary information by explicitly using cross-modal/level connections and modal/level-wise supervision to decrease fusion ambiguity. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{CTMF}  employs a computational model to identify salient objects from RGB-D scenes, utilizing CNNs to learn high-level representations for RGB images and depth cues, while simultaneously exploiting the complementary relationships and joint representation. Besides, this model transfers the structure of the model from the source domain (\\emph{i.e.}, RGB images) to be applicable to the target domain (\\emph{i.e.}, depth maps). \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{CPFP}  proposes a contrast-enhanced network to produce an enhanced map, and presents a fluid pyramid integration module to effectively fuse cross-modal information in a hierarchical manner. Besides, considering the fact that depth cues tend to suffer from noise, a feature-enhanced module is proposed to learn an enhanced depth cue for boosting the SOD performance. It is worth noting that this is an effective solution. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{UC-Net}  proposes a probabilistic RGB-D based SOD network via conditional variational autoencoders (VAEs) to model human annotation uncertainty. It generates multiple saliency maps for each input image by sampling in the learned latent space. This was the first work to investigate uncertainty in RGB-D based SOD, and was inspired by the data labeling process. This method leverages the diverse saliency maps to improve the final SOD performance. \n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\vspace {-4mm}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{Fig3.pdf} \\vspace {-1mm}\n    \\caption{Comparison of three fusion strategies that explore the correlation between RGB images and depth maps for RGB-D based SOD.

The existing fusion strategies can be grouped into three categories, including 1) early fusion, 2) multi-scale fusion, and 3) late fusion. We provide details for each fusion strategy as follows.\n\\textbf{Early Fusion}. Early fusion-based methods can follow one of two veins: 1) RGB images and depth maps are directly integrated to form a four-channel input . This is denoted as ``input fusion\" (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_1}); 2) RGB and depth images are first fed into each independent network and their low-level representations are combined as joint representations, which are then fed into a subsequent network for further saliency map prediction . This is denoted as ``early feature fusion\" (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_1}).  \n\\textbf{Late Fusion}. Late fusion-based methods can also be further divided into two families: 1) Two parallel network streams are adopted to learn high-level features for RGB and depth data, respectively, which are concatenated and then used for generating the final saliency prediction . This is denoted as ``later feature fusion\" (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_1}). 2) Two parallel network streams are used to obtain the independent saliency maps for RGB images and depth cues, and then the two saliency maps are concatenated to obtain a final prediction map . This is denoted as ``late result fusion\" (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_1}).\n\\textbf{Multi-scale Fusion}. To effectively explore the correlations between RGB images and depth maps, several methods propose a multi-scale fusion strategy . These models can be divided into two categories. The first category learn the cross-modal interactions and then fuse them into a feature learning network. For example, Chen \\etal~ developed a multi-scale multi-path fusion network to integrate RGB images and depth maps, with a cross-modal interaction (termed MMCI) module. This method introduces cross-modal interactions into multiple layers, which can empower additional gradients for enhancing the learning of the depth stream, as well as enable complementarity across low-level and high-level representations to be explored. The second category fuse the features from RGB images and depth maps in different layers and then integrate them into a decoder network (\\eg, skip connection) to produce the final saliency detection map (as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_1}). Some representative works are briefly discussed as follows.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{ICNet}  proposes an information conversion module to convert high-level features in an interactive manner. In this model, a cross-modal depth-weighted combination (CDC) block is introduced to enhance RGB features with depth features at different levels.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{DPANet}  uses a gated multi-modality attention (GMA) module to exploit long-range dependencies. The GMA module can extract the most discriminative features by utilizing a spatial attention mechanism. Besides, this model controls the fusion rate of the cross-modal information using a gate function, which can reduce some effects brought by the unreliable depth cues.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{BiANet}  employs a multi-scale bilateral attention module (MBAM) to capture better global information in multiple layers. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{JL-DCF}  treats a depth image as a special case of a color image and employs a shared CNN for both RGB and depth feature extraction. It also proposes a densely-cooperative fusion strategy to effectively combine the learned features from different modalities. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{BBS-Net}  uses a bifurcated backbone strategy (BBS) to split the multi-level feature representations into teacher and student features, and develops a depth-enhanced module (DEM) to explore informative parts in depth maps from the spatial and channel views. \n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\vspace {-4mm}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig4.pdf} \\vspace {-1mm}\n    \\caption{Examples of images, depth maps and annotations in nine RGB-D dataset, including (a) STERE , (b) NLPR  , (c) SSD , (d) GIT , (e) DES  , (f) LFSD , (g) NJUD , (h) DUT-RGBD , and (i) SIP .

Several RGB-D based SOD works  focus on a single-stream architecture to achieve saliency prediction. These models often fuse RGB images and depth information in the input channel or feature learning part. For example, MDSF  employs a multi-scale discriminative saliency fusion framework as the SOD model, in which four types of features in three levels are computed and then fused to obtain the final saliency map. BED  utilizes a CNN architecture to integrate bottom-up and top-down information for SOD, which also incorporates multiple features, including background enclosure distribution (BED) and low level depth maps (\\eg, depth histogram distance and depth contrast) to boost the SOD performance. PDNet  extracts depth-based features using a subsidiary network, which makes full use of depth information to assist the main-stream network.\n\\textbf{Multi-stream Models}. Two-stream models  consist of two independent branches that process RGB images and depth cues, respectively, and often generate different high-level features or saliency maps and then incorporate them in the middle stage or end of the two streams. It is worth noting that most recent deep learning-based models  utilize this two-stream architecture with several models capturing the correlations between RGB images and depth cues across multiple layers. Moreover, some models utilize a multi-stream structure  and then design different fusion modules to effectively fuse RGB and depth information in order to exploit their correlations.", "cites": [8144, 6220], "cite_extract_rate": 0.09090909090909091, "origin_cites_number": 22, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a basic description of single-stream and multi-stream models in RGB-D SOD, mentioning some representative works and their general mechanisms.

Tab~\\ref{tab:03} summarizes nine popular RGB-D datasets, and Fig.~\\ref{fig_03} shows examples of images (including RGB images, depth maps, and annotations) from these datasets. Moreover, we provide the details for each dataset as follows.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{STERE} . The authors first collected 1,250 stereoscopic images from Flickr \\footnote{http://www.flickr.com/}, NVIDIA 3D Vision Live \\footnote{http://photos.3dvisionlive.com/}, and Stereoscopic Image Gallery \\footnote{http://www.stereophotography.com/}. The most salient objects in each image were annotated by three users. All annotated images were then sorted based on the overlaping salient regions and the top 1,000 images were selected to construct the final dataset. This is the first collection of stereoscopic images in this field. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{GIT}  consists of 80 color and depth images, which were collected using a mobile-manipulator robot in a real-world home environment. Moreover, each image is annotated based on the pixel-level segmentation of the objects.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{DES}  consists of 135 indoor RGB-D images, which were taken by Kinect with a resolution of $640\\times{640}$. When collecting this dataset, three users were asked to label the salient object in each image, and then the overlapping areas of the labeled object were regarded as the ground truth.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{NLPR}  consists of 1,000 RGB images and their corresponding depth maps, which were obtained by a standard Microsoft Kinect. This dataset includes a series of outdoor and indoor locations, \\eg, offices, supermarkets, campuses, streets, and so on. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{LFSD}  includes 100 light fields collected using a Lytro light field camera, and consists of 60 indoor and 40 outdoor scenes. To label this dataset, three individuals were asked to manually segment salient regions, and then the segmented results were deemed ground truth when the overlap of the three results was over $90\\%$. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{NJUD}  consists of 1,985 stereo image pairs, and these images were collected from the internet, 3D movies, and photographs that are taken by a Fuji W3 stereo camera. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{SSD}  was constructed using three stereo movies and includes indoor and outdoor scenes. This dataset includes 80 samples, and each image has the size of $960\\times{1080}$.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{DUT-RGBD}  consists of 800 indoor and 400 outdoor scenes with their corresponding depth images. This dataset includes several challenging factors, \\ie, multiple or transparent objects, complex backgrounds, similar foregrounds and backgrounds, and low-intensity environments.\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{SIP}  consists of 929 annotated high-resolution images, with multiple salient persons in each image. In this dataset, depth maps were captured using a real smartphone (\\ie, Huawei Mate10). Besides, it is worth noting that this dataset covers diverse scenes, and various challenging factors, and is annotated with pixel-level ground truths.\nNote that a detailed dataset statistics analysis (including center bias, size of objects, background objects, object boundary conditions, and number of salient objects) can be found in . \n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.0}\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Summary of popular light field SOD methods.}\n    \\scriptsize\n    \\vspace {-2.5mm}\n    \\label{tab:031}\n    \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{4.4pt}\n    \\begin{tabular}{|p{0.3cm}|p{0.5cm}<{\\centering}|r|p{0.8cm}<{\\centering}|p{3.1cm}|p{9.0cm}|}\n        \\hline\n         No. & Year & Method & Pub.  & Dataset & Description \\\\ \\hline\\hline\n    1 & 2014 & LFS  & CVPR  & LFSD  & The first light-field saliency detection algorithm employs objectness and focusness cues based on the refocusing capability of the light field \\\\ \\hline  \n    2 & 2015 & WSC  & CVPR  & LFSD &  Uses a weighted sparse coding framework to learn a saliency/non-saliency dictionary \\\\ \\hline  \n    3 & 2015 & DILF  & IJCAI  & LFSD & Incorporates depth contrast to complement the disadvantage of color and conducts focusness-based background priors to boost the saliency detection performance \\\\ \\hline  \n    4 & 2016 & RL  & ICASSP  & LFSD & Utilizes the inherent structure information in light field images to improve saliency detection \\\\ \\hline  \n    5 & 2017 & MA  & TOMM  & HFUT, LFSD &  Integrates multiple saliency cues extracted from light field images using a random-search-based weighting strategy \\\\ \\hline  \n    6 & 2017 & BIF  & NPL  & LFSD & Integrates color-based contrast, depth-induced contrast, focusness map of foreground slice, and background weighted depth contrast using a two-stage Bayesian integration framework \\\\ \\hline \n    7 & 2017 & LFS  & TPAMI  & LFSD & An extension of  \\\\ \\hline    \n    8 & 2017 & RLM  & ICIVC  & LFSD & Utilizes the light field relative location measurement for SOD on light field images \\\\ \\hline    \n    9 & 2018 & SGDC  & CVPR  & LFSD & Designs a saliency-guided depth optimization framework for multi-layer light field displays \\\\ \\hline    \n    10 & 2018 & DCA  & FiO  & LFSD & Proposes a graph model depth-induced cellular automata to optimize saliency maps using light field data \\\\ \\hline  \n    11 & 2019 & DLLF  & ICCV  & DUTLF-FS, LFSD & Utilizes a recurrent attention network to fuse each slice from the focal stack to learn the most informative features  \\\\ \\hline  \n    12 & 2019 & DLSD  & IJCAI  & DUTLF-MV & Formulates saliency detection into two subproblems, including 1) light field synthesis from a single view and 2) light-field-driven saliency detection \\\\ \\hline  \n    13 & 2019 & Molf  & NIPS  & UTLF-FS & Uses a memory-oriented decoder for light field SOD \\\\ \\hline \n    14 & 2020 & ERNet  & AAAI  & DUTLF-FS, HFUT, LFSD & Uses an asymmetrical two-stream architecture to overcome computation-intensive and memory-intensive challenges in a high-dimensional light field data \\\\ \\hline \n    15 & 2020 & DCA  & TIP  & LFSD & Presents a saliency detection framework on light fields based on the depth-induced cellular automata (DCA) model.

We have already reviewed RGB-D based SOD models, in which depth maps provide layout information to improve SOD performance to some extent. However, inaccurate or low-quality depth maps often decrease the performance. To overcome this issue, light field SOD methods have been proposed to make use of rich information captured by the light field. Specifically, light field data contains an all-focus image, a focal stack, and a rough depth map . A summary of related light field SOD works is provided in Tab~\\ref{tab:031}. Further, to provide an in-depth understanding of these models, we also review them in more detail as follows.\n\\textbf{Traditional/Deep Models}. The classic models for light field SOD often use superpixel-level handcrafted features . Early work  showed that the unique refocusing capability of light fields can provide useful focusness, depth, and objectness cues. Thus, several SOD models using light field data were further proposed. For example, Zhang \\etal~ utilized a set of focal slices to compute the background prior, and then combined it with the location prior for SOD. Wang \\etal~ proposed a two-stage Bayesian fusion model to integrate multiple contrasts for boosting SOD performance. Recently, several deep learning-based light field SOD models  have also been developed, obtaining remarkable performance. Besides, in , an attentive recurrent CNN was developed to fuse all focal slices, while the data diversity was increased using adversarial examples to enhance model robustness. Zhang \\etal~ developed a memory-oriented decoder for light field SOD, which fuses multi-level features in a top-down manner using high-level information to guide low-level feature selection. LFNet  employs a new integration module to fuse features from light field data according to their contributions and captures the spatial structure of a scene to improve SOD performance. \n\\textbf{Refinement based Models}. Several refinement strategies have been used to enforce neighboring constraints or reduce the homogeneity of multiple modalities for SOD. For example, in , the saliency dictionary was refined using the estimated saliency map. The MA method  employs a two-stage saliency refinement strategy to produce the final prediction map, which enables adjacent superpixels to obtain similar saliency values. Besides, LFNet  presents an effective refinement module to reduce the homogeneity among different modalities as well refine their dissimilarities", "cites": [6246], "cite_extract_rate": 0.0625, "origin_cites_number": 16, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of light field SOD models by categorizing them into traditional/deep and refinement-based approaches. It synthesizes key methods and connects ideas across works, such as the use of focal slices and refinement strategies. However, it lacks deeper critical evaluation of the cited papers and could better articulate overarching principles or frameworks beyond method classification."}}

Given a saliency map $S$, we can convert it to a binary mask $M$, and then compute the \\emph{precision}\nand \\emph{recall} by comparing $M$ with ground-truth $G$:\n\\begin{equation}\nPrecision=\\frac{|M\\cap{G}|}{|M|},~ Recall=\\frac{|M\\cap{G}|}{|G|}.\n\\end{equation}\nA popular strategy is to partition the saliency map $S$ using a set of thresholds (\\ie, it changes from 0 to 255). For each threshold, we first calculate a pair of recall and precision scores, and then combine them to obtain a PR curve that describes the performance of the model at the different thresholds.\n$\\bullet$ {\\textbf{F-measure} ($F_{\\beta}$)}. To comprehensively consider both precision and recall, the F-measure is proposed by calculating the weighted harmonic mean:\n\\begin{equation}\nF_{\\beta}=\\left(1+\\beta ^2\\right)\\frac{P*R}{\\beta ^{2}P+R},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\beta^2$ is set to 0.3 to emphasize the precision . We use different fixed $[0,255]$ thresholds to  compute the $F$-measure metric. This yields a set of $F$-measure values for which we report the maximal or average $F_{\\beta}$.\n$\\bullet$ {\\textbf{MAE}}. This measures the average pixel-wise absolute error between a predicted saliency map $S$ and a ground truth $G$ for all pixels, which can be defined by\n\\begin{equation}\nMAE=\\frac{1}{W*H}\\sum_{i=1}^{W}\\sum_{i=1}^{H}\\left|S_{i,j}-G_{i,j} \\right|,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $W$ and $H$ denote the width and height of the map, respectively. MAE values are normalized to [0,1].\n$\\bullet$ {\\textbf{S-measure} ($S_{\\alpha}$)}. To capture the importance of the structural information in an image, $S_{\\alpha}$  is used to assess the structural similarity between the regional perception ($S_r$) and object perception ($S_o$). Thus, $S_{\\alpha}$ can be defined by\n\\begin{equation}\nS_{\\alpha}=\\alpha * S_{o}+\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)*S_{r},  \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $ \\alpha \\in \\left[ 0,1\\right]$ is a trade-off parameter.

We report the mean values of $S_{\\alpha}$ and {MAE} across the five datasets (STERE , NLPR  , LFSD , DES , and SIP ) for each model in Fig.~\\ref{fig_04}. It is worth noting that better models are shown in the upper left corner (\\ie, with a larger $S_{\\alpha}$ and smaller MAE). From Fig.~\\ref{fig_04}, we have following observations:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Traditional vs. Deep Models}. Compared with traditional RGB-D based SOD models, deep learning methods obtain significantly better performance. This confirms the powerful feature learning ability of deep networks. \n\\item \\textbf{Comparison of Deep Models}. Among the deep learning-based models, D{$^3$}Net , JL-DCF , UC-Net , SSF , {ICNet} , and S${^2}$MA  obtain the best performance. \n\\end{itemize}\nMoreover, Fig.~\\ref{fig_05} and Fig.~\\ref{fig_06} show the PR and F-measure curves for the 24 representative RGB-D based SOD models on eight datasets (\\ie, STERE , NLPR , LFSD , DES , SIP , GIT , SSD  , and NJUD ). Note that there are 1000, 300, 100, 135, 929, 80, and 80 test samples for NLPR, LFSD, DES, SIP, GIT, and SSD, respectively. For the NJUD  dataset, there are 485 test images for CPFP , S$^2$MA , ICNet , JL-DCF , and UC-Net , while 498 testing images for all other models. \nTo understand the top six models in depth, we discuss their main advantages for the six models below.\n$\\bullet$ D{$^3$}Net  consists of two key components, \\ie, a three-stream feature learning module and a depth depurator unit. In the three-stream feature learning module, there are three subnetworks, \\ie, RgbNet, RgbdNet, and DepthNet. The RgbNet and DepthNet are used to learn high-level feature representations for RGB and depth images, respectively, while the RgbdNet is used to learn their fused representations. It is worth noting that this three-stream feature learning module can capture modality-specific information as well as the correlation between modalities. Thus, balancing the two aspects is very important for multi-modal learning and it has helped to improve the SOD performance. Besides, the depth depurator unit acts as a gate to explicitly filter out low-quality depth maps, which several existing methods do not consider the effects. Because low-quality depth maps can inhibit the fusion between RGB images and depth maps, thus the depth depurator unit can ensure effective multi-modal fusion to achieve robust SOD performance.\n$\\bullet$ In JL-DCF , there are two key components, \\ie, a joint learning (JL) and a densely-cooperative fusion (DCF). Specifically, the JL module is used to learn robust saliency features, while the DCF module is used for complementary feature discovery. It is worth noting that this method uses a middle-fusion strategy to extract deep hierarchical features from RGB images and depth maps, in which the cross-modal complementarity can be effectively exploited to achieve accurate prediction.\n$\\bullet$ In UC-Net , instead of producing a single saliency prediction, this model produces multiple predictions by modeling the distribution of the feature output space as a generative model conditioned on RGB-D images. Because each person has some specific preferences in labeling a saliency map, it could fail to capture the stochastic characteristic of saliency while only a single saliency map is produced for an image pair using a deterministic learning pipeline. Thus, the strategy in this model can take into account human uncertainty in saliency annotations. Moreover, considering the fact that depth maps could suffer from noise, directly fusing RGB images and depth maps could cause the network to fit to this noise. Therefore, a depth correction network, designed as an auxiliary component, is proposed to refine depth information with a semantic guided loss. Thus, the above key components are all helpful for improving SOD performance. \n$\\bullet$ In SSF , a complementary interaction module (CIM) is developed to explore discriminative cross-modal complementarities and fuse cross-modal features, where a region-wise attention is introduced to supplement rich boundary information for each modality. Besides, a compensation-aware loss is proposed to improve the network’s confidence for hard samples in unreliable depth maps. Thus, these key components enable the proposed model to effectively explore and establish the complementarity of cross-modal feature representations, while at the same time reducing the negative effects introduced by low-quality depth maps, boosting SOD performance. \n$\\bullet$ In {ICNet} , an information conversion module is proposed to interactively and adaptively explore the correlations between high-level RGB and depth features. Besides, a cross-modal depth-weighted combination block is introduced to enhance the difference between the RGB and depth features in each level, which ensures that the features are treated differently. It is also worth noting that ICNet exploits the complementarity of cross-modal features, as well as explores the continuity of cross-level features, both of which are helpful for achieving accurate predictions. \n$\\bullet$ In S${^2}$MA , a self-mutual attention module (SAM) is proposed to fuse RGB and depth images, integrating self-attention and each other’s attention to propagate context more accurately. The SAM can provide additional complementary information from multi-modal data to improve SOD performance, overcoming the limitations of the original self-attention, which only uses a single modality. Besides, to reduce the low-quality (\\eg, noise) effects of depth cues, a selection mechanism is proposed to reweight the mutual attention. This mechanism can filter out unreliable information, resulting in more accurate saliency prediction. \n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.0}\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Attribute-based study \\emph{w.r.t.} background objects (\\ie, car, barrier, flower, grass, road, sign, tree, and other).

The scale ratios are denoted in yellow.}  \\label{fig_0072}\n\\end{figure}\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{Object Scale}. To characterize the scale of a salient object area, we compute the ratio between the size of the salient area and the whole image. We define three types of object scales: 1) when the ratio is less than 0.1, it is denoted as ``small\"; 2) when the ratio is larger than 0.4, it is denoted as ``large\"; and 3) when the ratio is in the range of $[0.1, 0.4]$, it is denoted as ``medium\". In this evaluation, we build a hybrid dataset with 2,464 images collected from STERE , NLPR  , LFSD , DES , and SIP , where 24\\%, 69.2\\% and 6.8\\% of images have small, medium, and large salient object areas, respectively.

D$^3$Net , SSF , A2dele , and ICNet  also obtain promising performance. \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{Fig9.pdf} \n    \\caption{Sample images with three types of background clutter.\n    }  \\label{fig_007}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{Fig10.pdf} \n    \\caption{Sample images with single or multiple salient objects.}  \\label{fig_0071}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\vspace {-4mm}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{Fig11.pdf} \\vspace {-0.45cm}\n    \\caption{Attribute-based study \\emph{w.r.t.} number of salient objects (\\ie, single vs. multiple (multi)).

It is difficult to directly characterize background clutter. Since classic SOD methods tend to use prior information or color contrast to locate salient objects, they often fail under complex backgrounds. Thus, in this evaluation, we utilize five traditional SOD methods, \\ie, BSCA , CLC , MDC , MIL , and WFD , to first detect salient objects in various images and then group these images into different categories (\\eg, simple or complex background) according to the results. Specifically, we first construct a hybrid dataset with 1,400 images collected from three datasets (STERE , NLPR , and LFSD ). Then, we apply the five models to this dataset and obtain the $S_{\\alpha}$ values for each, which we use to characterize images as follows: 1) If all $S_{\\alpha}$ values are higher than $0.9$, the image is denoted as having a ``simple\" background; 2) If all $S_{\\alpha}$ values are lower than $0.6$, the image is said to have a ``complex\" background; 3) The remaining images are denoted as ``uncertain\". Some example images with the three types of background clutter are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_007}. The constructed hybrid dataset can be found at \\href{https://github.com/taozh2017/RGBD-SODsurvey}{https://github.com/taozh2017/RGBD-SODsurvey}. The comparison results of the attribute-based study \\emph{w.r.t.} background clutter are shown in Tab.~\\ref{tab:007}. As can be seen, all models obtain worse SOD performance on images containing complex backgrounds than simple ones. Among the representative models, JL-DCF , UC-Net  and SSF  achieve the top-three best results. Besides, the four most recent models, \\ie, D$^3$Net , S$^2$MA , A2dele , and ICNet , also obtain better performance than the other models. \n\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.0}\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Attribute-based study \\emph{w.r.t.} light conditions (sunny vs. low-light).

In this evaluation, we construct a hybrid dataset with 1,229 images collected from the NLPR   and SIP  datasets. Some example images  with single or multiple salient objects are shown  in Fig.~\\ref{fig_0071}. The comparison results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_08}. From the results, we can see that it is easier to detect single salient object than multiple ones. \n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\vspace {-4mm}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=.98\\linewidth]{Fig13.pdf} \\vspace {-0.15cm}\n    \\caption{Visual comparisons for two classical non-deep methods (DCMC  and SE ) and three state-of-the-art CNN-based models (DMRA , D$^3$Net , SSF ).}  \\label{fig_010}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\vspace {-4mm}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Fig14.pdf} \\vspace {-0.45cm}\n    \\caption{Visual comparisons for five state-of-the-art CNN-based models (A2dele , S$^2$MA , ICNet , JL-DCF , and UC-Net ).}  \\label{fig_011}\n\\end{figure*}\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{Indoor vs. Outdoor}. We evaluate the performance of different RGB-D based SOD models on indoor and outdoor scenes. In this evaluation, we construct a hybrid dataset collected from the DES , NLPR , and LFSD  datasets. The comparison results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_09}. From the results, it can be seen that most models struggle more to detect salient objects in indoor scene than outdoor scenes. This is possibly because indoor environments often have varying light conditions. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{Background Objects}. We evaluate the performance of the RGB-D based SOD models when different background objects are present.  We use the SIP dataset , and split it into nine categories, \\ie, car, barrier, flower, grass, road, sign, tree, and other. The comparison results are shown in Tab.~\\ref{tab:010}. As can be seen, all methods obtain diverse performances under different background objects. Among the 24 representative RGB-D based models, JL-DCF , UC-Net  and SSF  achieve the top-three best results. In addition, the four most recent models, \\ie, D$^3$Net , S$^2$MA , A2dele , and ICNet  obtain better performance than the others. \n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{Lighting Conditions}. The performance of SOD can be affected by different lighting conditions. To determine the performance of different RGB-D based SOD models under different lighting conditions, we conduct an evaluation on the SIP dataset , which we split it into two categories, \\ie, sunny and low-light. The comparison results are shown in Tab.~\\ref{tab:011}. \nAs can be seen, low-light negatively impacts SOD performance. Among comparison models, UC-Net  obtains the best performance under sunny conditions while JL-DCF  achieves the best result under low-light condition. \nIn addition, we report the saliency maps generated for various challenging scenes to visualize the performance of different RGB-D based SOD models. Fig.~\\ref{fig_010} and Fig.~\\ref{fig_011} show some representative examples using two classic non-deep methods (DCMC  and SE ) and eight state-of-the-art CNN-based models (DMRA , D$^3$Net , SSF , A2dele , S$^2$MA , ICNet , JL-DCF , and UC-Net ). The $1^{st}$ row shows a small object, while the $2^{nd}$ row is an example of a large one. The $3^{rd}$ and  $4^{th}$ rows contain complex backgrounds and boundaries, respectively. The $5^{th}$ and  $6^{th}$ rows contain multiple salient objects. In the $7^{th}$ row, there are low-light condition. In the $8^{th}$ row, the depth map is coarse with very inaccurate object boundaries, which could inhibit the SOD performance. From the results in Fig.~\\ref{fig_010} and Fig.~\\ref{fig_011}, it can be observed that deep models perform better than non-deep models on these challenging scenes, confirming the powerful expression ability of deep features over handcrafted ones. In addition, D$^3$Net , S$^2$MA , JL-DCF , and UC-Net  perform better than other deep models.", "cites": [8141, 6218, 8144], "cite_extract_rate": 0.0967741935483871, "origin_cites_number": 31, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of RGB-D SOD models by conducting attribute-based evaluations, including object scale, background clutter, and lighting conditions.

Depth maps with affluent spatial information have been proven beneficial in detecting salient objects from cluttered backgrounds, while the depth quality also directly affects the subsequent SOD performance. The quality of depth maps varies tremendously across different scenarios due to the limitations of depth sensors, posing a challenge when trying to reduce the effects of low-quality depth maps. However, most existing methods directly fuse RGB images and original raw data from depth maps, without considering the effects of low-quality depth maps. There are a few notable exceptions. For example, in , a contrast-enhanced network was proposed to learn enhanced depth maps, which have much higher contrasts compared with the original depths. In , a compensation-aware loss was designed to pay more attention to hard samples containing unreliable depth information. Moreover, D{$^3$}Net  uses a depth depurator unit (DDU) to classify depth maps into two classes (\\ie, reasonable and low-quality). The DDU also acts as a gate that can filter out the low-quality depth maps. However, the above methods often employ a two-step strategy to achieve depth enhancement and multi-modal fusion  or an independent gate operation for filtering out poor depths, which could bring a suboptimal problem. There is thus a need to develop an end-to-end framework that can achieve depth enhancement or adaptively weight the depth maps (\\eg, assign low weights to poor depth maps) during multi-modal fusion, which would be more helpful for reducing the effects of low-quality depth maps and boosting SOD performance. \n\\textbf{Incomplete Depth Maps}. In RGB-D datasets, it is inevitable for there to be some low-quality depth maps due to the limitations of the acquisition devices. As previously discussed, several depth enhancement algorithms have been used to improve the quality of depth maps. However, depth maps that suffer from severe noise or blurred edges, are often discarded. In this case, we have complete RGB images but some samples do not have depth maps, which is similar to the incomplete multi-view/modal learning problem . Thus, we call it ``incomplete RGB-D based SOD\". As current models only focus on the SOD task using complete RGB images and depth maps, we believe this could be a new direction for RGB-D SOD. \n\\textbf{Depth Estimation}. Depth estimation provides an effective solution to recover high-quality depths and overcome the effects of low-quality depth maps. Various depth estimation approaches  have been developed, which could be introduced into the RGB-D based SOD task to improve performance.", "cites": [6249, 2324, 8147], "cite_extract_rate": 0.25, "origin_cites_number": 12, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section integrates multiple cited papers to highlight the importance of handling imperfect depth in RGB-D SOD and identifies common strategies like depth enhancement and gate-based filtering.

While it draws connections across the works, the abstraction remains moderate, framing the issue within the broader context of incomplete multi-modal learning but not offering a highly generalized framework."}}

It is important to effectively fuse RGB images and depth maps for RGB-D based SOD. Existing models often employ different fusion strategies (\\eg, early fusion, middle fusion, or late fusion) to exploit the correlations between RGB images and depth maps. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)  have gained widespread attention for the saliency detection task . In common GAN-based SOD models, a generator takes RGB images as inputs and generates the corresponding saliency maps, while a discriminator is adopted to determine whether a given image is synthetic or ground-truth. GAN-based models could easily be extended to RGB-D SOD, which could be helpful for boosting performance due to their superior feature learning ability. Moreover, GANs could also be used to learn common feature representations for RGB images and depth maps , which could help with feature or saliency map fusion and further boost the SOD performance.  \n\\textbf{Attention-induced Fusion}. Attention mechanisms have been widely applied to various deep learning-based tasks , allowing networks to selectively pay attention to a subset of regions for extracting discriminative and powerful features. Besides, co-attention mechanisms have been developed to explore the underlying correlations across multiple modalities, and are widely studied in visual question answering  and video object segmentation . Thus, for the RGB-D based SOD task, we could also develop attention-based fusion algorithms to exploit correlations between RGB images and depth cues to improve the performance.", "cites": [735, 529, 6253, 6250, 6252, 6254, 9135, 38, 6251], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8181818181818182, "origin_cites_number": 11, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key concepts from adversarial learning and attention mechanisms by linking their applications in SOD to broader computer vision tasks.

Semi-/weak supervision could also be introduced into RGB-D SOD, by leveraging image-level tags  and pseudo pixel-wise annotations , for improving the detection performance.

Thus it would be feasible to conduct the SOD task in real-world applications, \\eg, on smart devices. However, most existing methods include complicated and deep DNNs to increase the model capacity and achieve better performance, preventing them from being directly applied on real-work platforms. To overcome this, model compression  techniques could be used to learn compact RGB-D based SOD models with promising detection accuracy. Moreover, JL-DCF  utilizes a shared network to locate salient objects using RGB and depth views, which largely reduces the model parameters and makes real-world applications feasible.", "cites": [8141, 6258, 849], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes the key idea from two papers (JL-DCF and model compression) to address the challenge of deploying complex SOD models on real-world devices.

Thermal infrared cameras can capture the radiation emitted from any object with a temperature above absolute zero, making thermal infrared images insensitive to illumination conditions . Therefore, thermal images can provide supplementary information to improve SOD performance when salient objects suffer from varying light, reflective light, or shadows. Some RGB-T models  and datasets (VT821 , VT1000  and VT5000 ) have already been proposed over the past few years. Similar to RGB-D SOD, the key aim of RGB-T SOD is to fuse RGB and thermal infrared images and exploit the correlations between the two modalities.
