This network structure was first proposed by Fukushima in 1988 . It was not widely used then, however, due to limits of computation hardware for training the network. In the 1990s, LeCun et al.  applied a gradient-based learning algorithm to CNNs and obtained successful results for the handwritten digit classification problem. CNNs have been extremely successful in computer vision applications, such as face recognition, object detection, powering vision in robotics, and self-driving cars. CNN models have a standard structure consisting of alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers (often each pooling layer is placed after a convolutional layer). The last layers are a small number of fully-connected layers, and the final layer is a softmax classifier as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig-cnn}.  Every layer of a CNN transforms the input volume to an output volume of neuron activation, eventually leading to the final fully connected layers, resulting in a mapping of the input data to a 1D feature vector. In a nutshell, CNN comprises three main types of neural layers, namely, (i) convolutional layers, (ii) pooling layers, and (iii) fully connected layers. Each type of layer plays a diferent role.\n\\smallskip\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/fcn-cnn.pdf}}\n\\caption{In a fully connected layer (left), each unit is connected to all units of the previous layers. In a convolutional layer (right), each unit is connected to a constant number of units in a local region of the previous layer. Furthermore, in a convolutional layer, the units all share the weights for these connections, as indicated by the shared linetypes. Figure and description are taken from .}\n\\label{fig-fcnn-cnn}\n\\end{figure}\n\\hspace{-5mm}\\textit{(i) Convolution Layers}. In the convolutional layers, a CNN\nconvolves the whole image as well as the intermediate feature maps with different kernels, generating various feature maps. Exploiting the advantages of the convolution operation, several works have proposed it as a substitute for fully connected layers with a view to attaining faster learning times. Difference between a fully connected layer and a convolutional layer is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig-fcnn-cnn}.        \n\\smallskip\n\\hspace{-5mm}\\textit{(ii) Pooling Layers}. Pooling layers handle the reduction of the spatial dimensions of the input volume for the convolutional layers that immediately follow. The pooling layer does not affect the depth dimension of the volume. The operation performed by this layer is also called subsampling or downsampling, as the reduction of size leads to a simultaneous loss of information. However, such a loss is beneficial for the network because the network is forced to learn only meaningful feature representation. On top of that, the decrease in size leads to less computational overhead for the upcoming layers of the network, and also it works against overfitting. Average pooling and max pooling are the most commonly used strategies. In  a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling performances is given, whereas in  it was shown that max pooling can lead to faster convergence, select superior invariant features, and improve generalization. \n\\smallskip\n\\hspace{-5mm}\\textit{(iii) Fully Connected Layers}.\nFollowing several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is performed via fully connected layers. Neurons in a fully connected layer have full connections to all activation in the previous layer, as their name implies. Their activation can hence be computed with a matrix multiplication followed by a bias offset. Fully connected layers eventually convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D feature vector. The learned vector representations either could be fed forward for classification or could be used as feature vectors for further processing.\n\\subsubsection*{Object Detection and Segmentation}\nObject detection and segmentation are two of the most important and challenging branches of computer vision, which have been widely applied in real-world applications, such as monitoring security, autonomous driving and so on, with the purpose of locating instances of semantic objects of a certain class. In a nutshell, object detection is the task of identifying locating objects (with bounding boxes) in images. While the task of segmentation is to classify each pixel of images with objects (dog, cat, airplane, etc.). We refer readers to  for more information on these tasks. Fig. \\ref{fig-class-det-seg} visually contrasts the difference between these tasks.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/class_det_seg.png}}\n\\caption{Visual illustration of difference between tasks - Image Classification, Object Detection and Instance Segmentation.

An increase in availability of data allowed for successful usage of such robotic tools in real-world conditions. Taking advantage of the available data, combined with the availability of robots such as BoniRob  that navigate autonomously in fields, computer vision with deep learning has played a prominent role in realizing autonomous farming. Previously laborious jobs of actively tracking certain measurements of interest such as plant growth rate, plant stem position, biomass amount, leaf count, leaf area, inter crop spacing, crop plant count and others can now be done almost seamlessly. \n\\subsubsection*{Crop Identification and Classification}\nA crucial prerequisite for selective and plant-specific treatments is that farming robots need to be equipped with an effective plant identification and classification system providing the robot with the information where and when to trigger its actuators to perform the desired action in real-time. For example, weeds generally have no useful value in terms of food, nutrition or medicine yet they have accelerated growth and parasitically compete with actual crops for nutrients and space. Inefficient processes such as hand weeding has\nled to significant losses and increasing costs due to manual labour , which is why a lot of research is being done on crop vs weed classification and weed identification  and plant seedlings classification . This is extremely useful in improving the efficiency of precision farming techniques on weed control by modulating herbicide spraying appropriately to the level of weeds infestation. \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/three-modes.pdf}}\n\\caption{Top row of \\textbf{(a)} shows BoniRob  a ground-based remote sensing robot, \\textbf{(b)} shows an unmanned aerial vehicle , \\textbf{(c)} shows a satellite scanning large areas of land respectively.

However, existing deep learning networks achieving state-of-the-art performance in other research fields are not suitable for agricultural tasks of crop management such as irrigation , picking , pesticide spraying , and fertilization . The dominating cause is lack of diverse set of public benchmark datasets that are specifically designed for various agricultural missions. Some of the few rich datasets available are CropDeep  for detection, multi-modal datasets like Rosette plant or \\textit{Arabidopsis} datasets , Sorghum-Head , Wheat-Panicle , Crop/Weed segmentation , and Crop/Tassle segmentation . Fig. \\ref{fig-cropdeep} contains some examples from the CropDeep  dataset. Fig. \\ref{fig-rosette} depicts multi-modal annotations provided in the Rosette Plant Phenotyping dataset  i.e., annotations for detection, segmentation, leaf center along with otherwise rarely found meta data. \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/cropdeep.png}}\n\\caption{Some annotation examples from CropDeep dataset .}\n\\label{fig-cropdeep}\n\\end{figure}\nEfficient yield estimation from images is also one of the key tasks for farmers and plant breeders to accurately quantify the overall throughput of their ecosystem. Recent efforts in panicle or spike detection , leaf counting , fruit detection  as well as pixel-wise segmentation-based tasks such as panicle segmentation  show very promising results in this direction. \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/RosettePlant.pdf}}\n\\caption{Visual illustration of all types of annotations available in  dataset.}\n\\label{fig-rosette}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsubsection*{Crop Disease and Pest Recognition}\nModern technologies have given human society the ability to produce enough food to meet the demand of more than 7 billion people. However, food security remains threatened by a number of factors including climate change , the decline in pollinators , plant diseases , and others. Plant diseases are not only a threat to food security at the global scale, but can also have disastrous consequences for smallholder farmers whose livelihoods depend on healthy crops. India loses 35\\% of the annual crop yield due to plant diseases . In the developing world, more than 80 percent of the agricultural production is generated by smallholder farmers , and reports of yield loss of more than 50\\% due to pests and diseases are frequent . Furthermore, the largest fraction of hungry people (50\\%) live in smallholder farming households , making smallholder farmers a group that’s particularly vulnerable to pathogen-derived disruptions in food supply.\nOwing to these factors, timely disease and pest recognition becomes a priority task for farmers. In addition to that, farmers do not have many options other than consulting other fellow farmers or seeking help from government funded helplines . Availability of public datasets such as PlantVillage , PlantDoc  allowed for progress in the area of disease and pest detection. Recent research works in pest and insect detection , invasive species detection in marine aquaculture  and disease detection in plant leafs , Rice , Tomato , Banana , Grape , Sugarcane , Eggplant , Cucumber , Soybean , Olive , Tea , Coffee  and other similar works take encouraging steps towards disease-free agriculture. Fig. \\ref{fig-disease} depicts banana diseases and pest detection outputs from . This work  reports solutions to extant limitations in plant disease detection.  \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/banana.png}}\n\\caption{Detected classes and expected output of the trained disease detection model. \\textbf{a} Entire plant afected by banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), \\textbf{b} leaves affected by black sigatoka (BS), \\textbf{c} cut pseudostem of Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) afected plant showing yellow bacterial ooze, \\textbf{d} fruit bunch afected by Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), e cut fruit afected by Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), \\textbf{f} corm afected by banana corm weevil (BCW).

In contrast with the platforms of manned aircraft and satellite, the UAV platform holds many promising characteristics: flexibility, efficiency, high spatial/temporal resolution, low cost, easy operation, etc., which make it an effective complement to other remote-sensing platforms and a cost-effective means for remote sensing. We refer reader to literary works  for the detailed reports of techniques and applications of UAVs in precision agriculture, remote sensing, search and rescue, construction and infrastructure inspection and discuss other market opportunities. UAVs can be utilized in precision agriculture (PA) for crop management and monitoring , weed detection , irrigation scheduling , agricultural pattern detection , pesticide spraying , cattle detection , disease detection , insect detection  and data collection from ground sensors (moisture, soil properties, etc.,) . The deployment of UAVs in PA is a cost-effective and time saving technology which can help for improving crop yields, farms productivity and profitability in farming systems. Moreover, UAVs facilitate agricultural management, weed monitoring, and pest damage, thereby they help to meet these challenges quickly . \nUAVs can also be utilized to monitor and quantify several factors of irrigation such as availability of soil water, crop water need (which represents the amount of water needed by the various crops to grow optimally), rainfall amount, efficiency of the irrigation system . In this work , UAVs are currently being utilized to estimate the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture high-resolution multi-spectral imagery in combination with ground sampling. UAVs are also being used for thermal remote sensing to monitor the spatial and temporal patterns of crop diseases during various disease development phases which reduces crop losses for farmers. This work  detects early stage development of soil-borne fungus in UAV imagery.  Soil texture can be an indicative of soil quality which in turn influences crop productivity. Hence, UAV thermal images are being utilized to quantify soil texture at a regional scale by measuring the differences in land surface temperature under a relatively homogeneous climatic condition . Accurate assessment of crop residue is crucial for proper implementation of conservation tillage practices since crop residues provide a protective layer on agricultural fields that shields soil from wind and water. In , the authors demonstrated that aerial thermal images can explain more than 95\\% of the variability in crop residue cover amount compared to 77\\% using visible and near IR images.\nFarmers must monitor crop maturity to determine the harvesting time of their crops. UAVs can be a practical solution to this problem . Farmers require accurate, early estimation of crop yield for a number of reasons, including crop insurance, planning of harvest and storage requirements, and cash flow budgeting. In , UAV images were utilized to estimate yield and total biomass of rice crop in Thailand. In , UAV images were also utilized to predict corn grain yields in the early to midseason crop growth stages in Germany. \nThere have also been successful efforts that seamlessly combine aerial and ground based system for precision agriculture . With relaxed flight regulations and drastic improvement in machine learning techniques, geo-referencing, mosaicing, and other related algorithms, UAVs can provide a great potential for soil and crop monitoring .

Phenotyping tasks are often specific to the environmental and genetic conditions, finding large datasets with such conditions is not always possible. This results in researchers needing to acquire their own dataset and label it, which is often a arduous and expensive affair. Moreover, small datasets often lead to models that overfit. Deep learning approaches optimized for working with limited labeled data would immensely help the plant phenotyping community, since this would encourage many more farmers, breeders, and researchers to employ reliable plant phenotyping techniques to optimize crop yield. To this end, we list out some of the recent efforts in the area of deep plant phenotyping with limited labeled data.\n\\subsection*{Data Augmentation}\nThe computer vision community has long been employing dataset augmentation techniques to grow the amount of data using artificial transformations. Artificially perturbing the original dataset with affine transformations (e.g., rotation, scale, translation) is considered a common practice now. However, this approach has some constraints: the augmented data only capture the variability of the available training set (e.g., if the dataset doesn't include a unique colored fruit, the particular unique case will never be learnt). To overcome this, several data augmentation methods proposed take advantage of recent advancements in the image generation space. In this work , the authors use Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  to generate \\textit{Arabidopsis} plant images (called ARIGAN) with unique desirable traits (over 7 leaves) that were originally less frequent in the dataset. Fig. \\ref{fig-generated} \\textbf{(a)} shows examples of images generated by ARIGAN. Other latest works  use more advanced variants of GANs to generate realistic plant images with particularly favorable leaf segmentations of interest to boost leaf counting accuracy of the learning models. In , the authors proposed an unsupervised image translation technique to improve plant disease recognition performance. LeafGAN , an image-to-image translation model, generates leaf images with various plant diseases and boosts diagnostic performance by a great margin. Two sets of example images generated by LeafGAN are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig-generated} \\textbf{(b)}. Other data enhancement techniques are also being employed by researchers to train plant disease diagnosis models on generated lesions . \nThe effort to provide finely annotated data has enabled great improvement of the state of the art on segmentation performance. Some researches have started working on effectively transferring the knowledge obtained from RGB images on annotated plants either to other species or other modalities of imaging. In this work , the authors successfully transfer the knowledge gained from annotated leaves of \\textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} in RGB to images of the same plant in chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{figures/generated.pdf}}\n\\caption{\\textbf{(a)} shows \\textit{Arabidopsis} plant images generated by ARIGAN . Bottom-right numbers refer to the leaf count. \\textbf{(b)} shows two sets of healthy leafs and their corresponding disease prone leaves generated by LeafGAN .}\n\\label{fig-generated}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection*{Weakly Supervised Learning}\nFruit/organ counting is a well explored task by the plant phenotyping community. However, many vision-based solutions we have currently require highly accurate instance and density labels of fruits and organs in diverse set of environments. The labeling procedures are often very burdensome and error prone and, in many agricultural scenarios, it may be impossible to acquire a sufficient number of labelled samples to achieve consistent performance that are robust to image noise or other forms of covariate shift. This is why using only weak labels can be crucial for cost-effective plant phenotyping. \nRecently, a lot of attention has been placed on engineering weakly supervised learning frameworks for plant phenotyping. In , the authors created a weakly supervised framework for the sorghum head detection task where annotators label the data only until the model reaches a desired performance level. After that, model outputs are directly passed as data labels leading to a exponential reduction in annotation costs with minimal loss in model accuracy. In other work , the authors proposed a strategy which is able to learn to count fruits without requiring task-specific supervision labels, such as manually labelled object bounding boxes or total instance count. In , the authors use a trained CNN on defect classification data and use it's activate maps to segment infected regions on potatoes. Segmentation task requires really rich labels (each pixel of the image is annotated) so this task effectively bypasses the labeling for segmentation altogether. On another note, rice heading date estimation greatly assists the breeders to understand the adaptability of the crop to various environmental and genetic conditions. Accurate estimation of heading date requires monitoring the increase in number of rice panicles in the crop. Detecting rice panicles from crop images usually requires training an object detection model such as Faster R-CNN or YOLO, which requires costly bounding box annotations. However, a recently proposed method  uses a sliding window based detector which requires training an image classifier, for which annotations are much easier to obtain. \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/bmvc.jpg}}\n\\caption{\\textbf{(a)} Standard pool-based active learning framework \\textbf{(b)} Proposed framework  which interleaves weak supervision in the active learning process. This novel framework includes an adaptive supervision module which allows switching to a stronger form of supervision as required when training the model. The \\textit{oracle} is the source of labels \\textit{a.k.a} annotator.}\n\\label{fig-bmvc}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection*{Transfer Learning}\nTransfer learning is a type of learning that enables using knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem i.e., a model trained on one phenotyping task (say potato leaf classification) being able to assist another phenotyping (tomato leaf classification) task. Transfer learning is a very well explored area of machine learning. As part of the first steps of adopting existing transfer learning techniques for plant phenotyping, the authors of  use CNNs (AlexNet, GoogleNet and VGGNet) pretrained on ImageNet dataset  and fine tune on the plant dataset used in LifeCLEF  2015 challenge. With the help of transfer learning, they were able to beat then existing state-of-the-art LifeCLEF performance by 15\\% points. Similary in , the authors report better than human results in segmentation task with the help of transfer learning where they transfer learn a model trained on peanut root dataset for switchgrass root dataset (they also report results using ImageNet pretrained models). Leaf disease detection and treatment recommendation performance is also shown to be boosted with transfer learning .  In , the authors interestingly combined a State-of-the-Art weakly-supervised fruit counting model with an unsupervised style transfer method for fruit counting. They used Cycle-Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) to perform unsupervised domain adaptation from one fruit dataset to another and train it alongside with a Presence-Absence Classifier (PAC) that discriminates images containing fruits or not and ultimately achieved better performance than fully supervised models. \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{figures/bmc.jpg}}\n\\caption{Proposed point supervision framework  into the pool-based active learning cycle. In this framework, strong supervision is queried for images only after deemed \\textit{informative} based on point supervision of those images.}\n\\label{fig-bmc}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection*{Active Learning}\nActive learning , an iterative training approach that curiously selects the best samples to train, has been shown to reduce labeled data requirement when training deep classification networks . Research in the area of active learning for object detection  has been, arguably, limited. However, numerous plant phenotyping tasks such as detection and quantification of crop yield and fruit counting are directly dependent on object detection. Keeping this in mind, an active learning method has been proposed  for training deep object detection models where the model can selectively query either weak labels (pointing at the object) or strong labels (drawing a box around the object). By introducing a switching module for weak labels and strong labels, the authors were able to save 24\\% of annotation time while training a wheat head detection  model. Fig. \\ref{fig-bmvc} illustrates the difference between regular active learning cycle and proposed active learning cycle. This method demonstrates the applicability of active learning to plant phenotyping methods where obtaining labeled data is often difficult. Along the same lines, to alleviate the labeled data requirement for training object detection models for cereal crop detection, a weak supervision based active learning method  was proposed recently. In this active learning approach, the model constantly interacts with a human annotator by iteratively querying the labels for only the most informative images, as opposed to all images in a dataset. Fig. \\ref{fig-bmc} visually illustrates the proposed framework. The active query method is specifically designed for cereal crops which usually tend to have panicles with low variance in appearance. This training method has been shown to reduce over 50\\% of annotation costs on sorghum head and wheat spike detection datasets. We expect to see more research works using active learning for limited labeled data based plant phenotyping in the near future.", "cites": [7217, 1050, 1051, 1048, 1045, 1041, 1047, 1043, 1049, 1044, 1042, 1046, 7323], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 28, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes several approaches to address limited labeled data in plant phenotyping, including data augmentation, weakly supervised learning, and transfer learning, and integrates them into a coherent narrative.
