These {architectural innovations} have enabled the training of deeper, more accurate and more efficient models. The recent research on neural architecture search (NAS)  further speeds up the process of designing more powerful structures. However, most of the prevalent deep learning models perform inference in a static manner, i.e., both the computational graph and the network parameters are fixed once trained, which may limit their representation power, efficiency and interpretability . \nDynamic networks, as opposed to static ones, can adapt their structures or parameters to the input during inference, and therefore enjoy favorable properties that are absent in static models. In general, dynamic computation in the context of deep learning has the following advantages: \n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\centering\n  \\vspace{-2ex}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.875\\linewidth]{1_overall.pdf}\n    \\vskip -0.175in\n    \\centering\\caption{Overview of the survey. {We first review the dynamic networks that perform adaptive computation at three different granularities (i.e. sample-wise, spatial-wise and temporal-wise). Then we summarize the decision making strategy, training technique and applications of dynamic models. Existing open problems in this field together with some future research directions are finally discussed. Best viewed in color.}}\n    \\label{framework}\n    \\vspace{-3ex}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\textbf{1) Efficiency.} One of the most notable advantages of dynamic networks is that they are able to allocate computations on demand at test time, by selectively activating model components (e.g. layers , channels  or sub-networks ) \\emph{conditioned} on the input. Consequently, less computation is spent on canonical samples that are relatively easy to recognize, or on less informative spatial/temporal locations of an input. {In addition to \\emph{computational efficiency}, dynamic models have also shown promising results for improving \\emph{data efficiency} in the scenario of few-shot learning .}\n\\textbf{2) Representation power.} Due to the data-dependent network architecture/parameters, dynamic networks have significantly enlarged parameter space and improved representation power. For example, with a minor increase of computation, model capacity can be boosted by applying feature-conditioned attention weights on an ensemble of convolutional kernels . It is worth noting that the popular soft attention mechanism could also be unified in the framework of dynamic networks, as different channels , spatial areas  or temporal locations  of features are dynamically re-weighted at test time. \n\\textbf{3) Adaptiveness.} Dynamic models are able to achieve a desired trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for dealing with varying computational budgets on the fly. Therefore, they are more adaptable to different hardware platforms and changing environments, compared to static models with a fixed computational cost.\n\\textbf{4) Compatibility.} Dynamic networks are compatible with most advanced techniques in deep learning, including architecture design , optimization algorithms  and data preprocessing , which ensures that they can benefit from the most recent advances in the field to achieve state-of-the-art performance. For example, dynamic networks can inherit architectural innovations in lightweight models , or be designed via NAS approaches . Their efficiency could also be further improved by acceleration methods developed for static models, such as network pruning , weight quantization , knowledge distillation  and low-rank approximation .\n\\textbf{5) Generality.} As a substitute for static deep learning techniques, many dynamic models are general approaches that can be applied seamlessly to a wide range of applications, such as image classification , object detection  and semantic segmentation . Moreover, the techniques developed in CV tasks are proven to transfer well to language models in NLP tasks , and vice versa.\n\\textbf{6) Interpretability.} We finally note that the research on dynamic networks {may bridge} the gap between the underlying mechanism of deep models and brains, as it is believed that the brains process information in a dynamic way~. It is possible to analyze which components of a dynamic model are activated  when processing an input sample, and to observe which parts of the input are accountable for certain predictions . These properties may shed light on interpreting the decision process of DNNs.\n\\begin{table}\n  \\vspace{-1ex}\n  \\caption{Notations used in this paper.}\n  \\label{tab:notations}\n  \\vspace{-4ex}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|c}\n      \\hline\n      \\textbf{Notations} & \\textbf{Descriptions} \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathbb{R}^m$ & $m$-dimensional real number domain \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $a, \\mathbf{a}$ & Scalar, vector/matrix/tensor \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathbf{x,y}$ & Input, output feature \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell}$ & Feature at layer $\\ell$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathbf{h}_t$ & Hidden state at time step $t$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathbf{x(p)}$ & Feature at spatial location $\\mathbf{p}$ on $\\mathbf{x}$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\bm{\\Theta}$ & Learnable parameter \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\bm{\\hat{\\Theta}}|\\mathbf{x}$ & Dynamic parameter conditioned on $\\mathbf{x}$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathbf{x}\\star\\mathbf{W}$ & Convolution of feature $\\mathbf{x}$ and weight $\\mathbf{W}$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\otimes$ & Channel-wise or element-wise multiplication \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathcal{F}(\\cdot,\\bm{\\Theta})$ & Functional Operation parameterized by $\\bm{\\Theta}$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n      $\\mathcal{F}\\circ\\mathcal{G}$ & Composition of function $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\vskip -0.35in\n\\end{table}\nIn fact, adaptive inference, the key idea underlying dynamic networks, has been studied before the popularity of modern DNNs. The most classical approach is building a model ensemble through a cascaded  or parallel  structure, and selectively activating the models conditioned on the input. Spiking neural networks (SNNs)  also perform data-dependent inference by propagating pulse signals. However, the training strategy for SNNs is quite different from that of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and they are less used in vision tasks. Therefore, we leave out the work related to SNNs in this survey. \n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n    \\vspace{-1ex}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{2_dynamic_cascade.pdf}\n    \\vskip -0.15in\n    \\caption{Two early-exiting schemes.

This motivates us to write this survey, to review the recent advances in this rapidly developing area, with the purposes of 1) providing an overview as well as new perspectives for researchers who are interested in this topic; 2) pointing out the close relations of different subareas and reducing the risk of reinventing the wheel; and 3) summarizing the key challenges and possible future research directions.\n{This survey is organized as follows (see \\figurename~\\ref{framework} for an overview). In Sec. \\ref{sec_sample_wise}, we introduce the most common \\emph{sample-wise} dynamic networks which adapt their architectures or parameters conditioned on each input sample.

Feature $\\mathbf{x}_4$ in (a) are not calculated conditioned on the halting score, and the gating module in (b) decides whether to execute the block based on the intermediate feature. The policy network in (c) generates the skipping decisions for all layers in the main network.}\n    \\label{skipping_layers}\n    \\vspace{-3ex}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\noindent\\textbf{1) Early exiting.} The complexity (or \"difficulty\") of input samples varies in most real-world scenarios, and shallow networks are capable of correctly identifying many canonical inputs. Ideally, these samples should be output at certain early exits without executing deeper layers.\nFor an input sample $\\mathbf{x}$, the forward propagation of an $L$-layer deep network $\\mathcal{F}$ could be represented by \n\\begin{equation}\n  \\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{3pt}\n  \\mathbf{y} = \\mathcal{F}^{L}\\circ\\mathcal{F}^{L-1}\\circ\\cdots\\circ\\mathcal{F}^1(\\mathbf{x}),\n  \\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{3pt}\n\\end{equation}\n\\noindent where $\\mathcal{F}^{\\ell}$ denotes the operational function at layer $\\ell,1\\!\\le \\ell\\!\\le L$. In contrast, early exiting allows to terminate the inference procedure at an intermediate layer. For the $i$-th input sample $\\mathbf{x}_i$, the forward propagation can be written as\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{3pt}\n  \\mathbf{y}_i = \\mathcal{F}^{\\ell_i}\\circ\\mathcal{F}^{\\ell_i-1}\\circ\\cdots\\circ\\mathcal{F}^1(\\mathbf{x}_i), 1\\!\\le \\ell_i\\!\\le L.\n  \\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{3pt}\n\\end{equation}\nNote that $\\ell_i$ is adaptively determined based on $\\mathbf{x}_i$. Extensive architectures have been studied to endow DNNs with such early exiting behaviors, as discussed in the following.\na) \\emph{Cascading of DNNs.} The most intuitive approach to enabling early exiting is cascading multiple models (see \\figurename~\\ref{cascading_models} (a)), and adaptively retrieving the prediction of an early network without activating latter ones. For example, Big/little-Net  cascades two CNNs with different depths. After obtaining the \\emph{SoftMax} output of the first model, early exiting is conducted when the score margin between the two largest elements exceeds a threshold. {Moreover, a number of classic CNNs  are cascaded in  and }. After each model, a decision function is trained to determine whether the obtained feature should be fed to a linear classifier for immediate prediction, or be sent to subsequent models.\nb) \\emph{Intermediate classifiers.}\nThe models in the aforementioned cascading structures are mutually independent. Consequently, \nonce a \"difficult\" sample is decided to be fed to a latter network, a whole inference procedure needs to be executed from scratch without reusing the already learned features. A more compact design is involving intermediate classifiers within one backbone network (see \\figurename~\\ref{cascading_models} (b)), so that early features can be propagated to deep layers if needed. Based on such a  multi-exit architecture, adaptive early exiting is typically achieved according to confidence-based criteria  or learned functions .\nc) \\emph{Multi-scale architecture with early exits.} Researchers  have observed that in chain-structured networks, the multiple classifiers may interfere with each other, which degrades the overall performance. A reasonable interpretation could be that in regular CNNs, the high-resolution features lack the coarse-level information that is essential for classification, leading to unsatisfying results for early exits. Moreover, early classifiers would force the shallow layers to generate \\emph{task-specialized} features, while a part of \\emph{general} information is lost, resulting in degraded performance for deep exits. To tackle this issue, multi-scale dense network (MSDNet)  adopts 1) a \\emph{multi-scale} architecture, {which consists of multiple sub-networks for processing feature maps with different resolutions (scales)}, to quickly generate coarse-level features that are suitable for classification; 2) \\emph{dense connections}, to reuse early features and improve the performance of deep classifiers (see \\figurename~\\ref{multi_scale} (a)). Such a specially-designed architecture effectively enhances the overall accuracy of all the classifiers in the network. \n{Based on the multi-scale architecture design, researchers have also studied the exiting policies  (see \\figurename~\\ref{multi_scale} (b)) and training schemes  of early-exiting dynamic models. More discussion about the inference and training schemes for dynamic models will be presented in Sec. \\ref{inference_and_train}.}\nPrevious methods typically achieve the adaptation of network depths. From the perspective of exploiting spatial redundancy in features, resolution adaptive network (RANet, see \\figurename~\\ref{multi_scale} (c))  first processes each sample with low-resolution features, while high-resolution representations are conditionally utilized based on early predictions.\nAdaptive early exiting is also extended to language models (e.g. BERT ) for improving their efficiency on NLP tasks . In addition, it can be implemented in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for \\emph{temporally} dynamic inference when processing sequential data such as videos  and texts  (see Sec. \\ref{sec_temporal_adaptive}).\n\\noindent\\textbf{2) Layer skipping.} The general idea of the aforementioned early-exiting paradigm is skipping the execution of all the deep layers after a certain classifier. More flexibly, the network depth can also be adapted on the fly by strategically skipping the calculation of \\emph{intermediate layers} without placing extra classifiers. Given the $i$-th input sample $\\mathbf{x}_i$, dynamic layer skipping could be generally written as\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{3pt}\n  \\mathbf{y}_i = (\\mathds{1}^{L}\\circ\\mathcal{F}^{L})\\circ (\\mathds{1}^{L-1}\\circ\\mathcal{F}^{L-1})\\circ\\cdots\\circ (\\mathds{1}^1\\circ\\mathcal{F}^1)(\\mathbf{x}_i),\n  \\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{3pt}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathds{1}^{\\ell}$ denotes the indicator function determining the execution of layer $\\mathcal{F}^{\\ell}, 1\\!\\le\\!\\ell\\!\\le\\!L$.\nThis scheme is typically implemented on structures with skip connections (e.g. ResNet ) to guarantee the continuity of forward propagation, and here we summarize three common approaches.\na) \\emph{Halting score} is first proposed in , where an accumulated scalar named halting score adaptively decides whether the hidden state of an RNN will be directly fed to the next time step. The halting scheme is extended to vision tasks by viewing residual blocks within a ResNet stage \\footnote{Here we refer to a stage as a stack of multiple residual blocks with the same feature resolution.} as linear layers within a step of RNN  (see \\figurename~\\ref{skipping_layers} (a)).\nRather than skipping the execution of layers with independent parameters, multiple blocks in each ResNet stage could be replaced by one weight-sharing block, leading to a significant reduction of parameters . In every stage, the block is executed for an adaptive number of steps according to the halting score.\nIn addition to RNNs and CNNs, the halting scheme is further implemented on Transformers  by  and  to achieve dynamic network depth on NLP tasks.\nb) {\\emph{Gating function} is also a prevalent option for dynamic layer skipping due to its plug-and-play property.} Take ResNet as an example (see \\figurename~\\ref{skipping_layers} (b)), let $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell}$ denote the input feature of the $\\ell$-th residual block, gating function $\\mathcal{G}^{\\ell}$ generates a binary value to decide the execution of residual block $\\mathcal{F}^{\\ell}$. This procedure could be represented by\\footnote{For simplicity and without generality, the subscript for sample index will be omitted in the following.}\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{3pt}\n  \\mathbf{x}^{\\ell+1} = \\mathcal{G}^{\\ell}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell})\\mathcal{F}^{\\ell}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell}) + \\mathbf{x}^{\\ell}, \\mathcal{G}^{\\ell}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ell})\\in\\{0,1\\}.\n  \\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{3pt}\n\\end{equation}\nSkipNet  and convolutional network with adaptive inference graph (Conv-AIG)  are two typical approaches to enabling dynamic layer skipping. Both methods induce lightweight computational overheads to efficiently produce the binary decisions on whether skipping the calculation of a residual block. Specifically, Conv-AIG utilizes two FC layers in each residual block, while the gating function in SkipNet is implemented as an RNN for parameter sharing.\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\centering\n  \\vspace{-2ex}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth]{5_multi_branch.pdf}\n    \\vskip -0.175in\n    \\caption{MoE with soft weighting (a) and hard gating (b) schemes both adopt an auxiliary module to generate the weights or gates. In the tree structure (c), features (nodes) and transformations (paths) are represented as circles and lines with arrows respectively. Only the full lines are activated.}\n    \\label{multi_branch}\n    \\vspace{-3ex}\n\\end{figure*}\nRather than skipping layers in classic ResNets, dynamic recursive network  iteratively executes one block with shared parameters in each stage. Although the weight-sharing scheme seems similar to the aforementioned IamNN , the skipping policy of  differs significantly: gating modules are exploited to decide the recursion depth.\nInstead of either skipping a layer, or executing it thoroughly with a full numerical precision, a line of work  studies adaptive \\emph{bit-width} for different layers conditioned on the \\emph{resource budget}. Furthermore, fractional skipping  adaptively selects a bit-width for each residual block by a gating function based on \\emph{input features}.\nc) {\\emph{Policy network} can be built to take in an input sample, and directly produces the skipping decisions for all the layers in a backbone network  (see \\figurename~\\ref{skipping_layers} (c)).}\n\\vspace{-1.5ex}", "cites": [698, 695, 7273, 305, 693, 683, 690, 691, 7269, 8373, 38, 7270, 697, 97, 692, 694, 696, 676, 7272, 7271, 7266, 689, 7], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6216216216216216, "origin_cites_number": 37, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.2, "critical": 3.3, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by organizing diverse approaches (early exiting, layer skipping, multi-scale designs) into a coherent framework, showing how they relate to dynamic depth.

It is commonly believed that different neuron units are responsible for representing different features, and therefore not all of them need to be activated for every sample. Early studies learn to adaptively control the neuron activations by auxiliary branches  or other techniques such as low-rank approximation .\n\\noindent\\textbf{2) {Skipping branches in mixture-of-experts (MoE).}} In Sec. \\ref{dynamic_depth}, adaptive model ensemble is achieved via a \\emph{cascading} way, and later networks are conditionally executed based on early predictions. An alternative approach to improving the model capacity is the MoE  structure, which means that multiple network branches are built as experts in \\emph{parallel}. \nThese experts could be selectively executed, and their outputs are fused with data-dependent weights.\nConventional \\emph{soft} MoEs  adopt real-valued weights to dynamically rescale the representations obtained from different experts (\\figurename~\\ref{multi_branch} (a)). In this way, all the branches still need to be executed, and thus the computation cannot be reduced at test time. \\emph{Hard} gates with only a fraction of non-zero elements are developed to increase the inference efficiency of the MoE structure (see \\figurename~\\ref{multi_branch} (b)) : let $\\mathcal{G}$ denote a gating module whose output is a $N$-dimensional vector $\\bm{\\alpha}$ controlling the execution of $N$ experts $\\mathcal{F}_1,\\mathcal{F}_2, \\cdots, \\mathcal{F}_N$, the final output can be written as\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq_moe}\n  \\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{3pt}\n  \\mathbf{y} = \\sum\\nolimits_{n=1}^N [\\mathcal{G}(\\mathbf{x})]_n \\mathcal{F}_n (\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum\\nolimits_{n=1}^N \\alpha_n \\mathcal{F}_n (\\mathbf{x}),\n  \\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{3pt}\n\\end{equation}\nand the $n$-th expert will not be executed if $\\alpha_n\\! =\\!0$. \nHard MoE has been implemented in diverse network structures. For example, HydraNet  replaces the convolutional blocks in a CNN by multiple branches, and selectively execute them conditioned on the input. For another example, dynamic routing network (DRNet)  performs a branch selection in each cell structure which is commonly used in NAS . On NLP tasks, sparely gated MoE  and switch Transformer  embeds hard MoE in a long short-term memory (LSTM)  network and a Transformer , respectively. Instead of making choice with \\emph{binary} gates as in , only the branches corresponding to the \\emph{top-K} elements of the real-valued gates are activated in .\n\\noindent\\textbf{{3) Skipping channels in CNNs.}}\nModern CNNs usually have considerable channel redundancy. Based on the common belief that the same feature channel can be of disparate importance for different samples, adaptive width of CNNs could be realized by dynamically activating convolutional channels. Compared to the \\emph{static} pruning methods  which remove \"unimportant\" filters permanently, such a \\emph{data-dependent} pruning approach improves the inference efficiency without degrading the model capacity.\na) \\emph{Multi-stage architectures along the channel dimension.} Recall that the early-exiting networks  discussed in Sec. \\ref{dynamic_depth} can be viewed as multi-stage models along the \\emph{depth} dimension, where late stages are conditionally executed based on early predictions. One can also build multi-stage architectures along the \\emph{width} (channel) dimension, and progressively execute these stages on demand.\nAlong this direction, an optimal architecture is searched among multiple structures with different widths, and any sample can be output at an early stage when a confident prediction is obtained . Channel gating network (CGNet)  first executes a subset of convolutional filters in every layer, and the remaining filters are only activated on strategically selected areas.\nb) \\emph{Dynamic pruning with gating functions.} In the aforementioned progressive activation paradigm, the execution of a later stage is decided based on previous output. As a result, a complete forward propagation is required for every stage, which might be suboptimal for reducing the practical inference latency. Another prevalent solution is to decide the execution of channels at every layer by gating functions. For example, runtime neural pruning (RNP)  models the layer-wise pruning as a Markov decision process, and an RNN is used to select specific channel groups at every layer. Moreover, pooling operations followed by FC layers are utilized to generate {\\emph{channel-wise hard attention} (i.e. making discrete decisions on whether to activate each channel)} for each sample .

The CapsuleNets  also perform dynamic routing between capsules, i.e. groups of neurons, to character the relations between (parts of) objects. Here we mainly focus on specific architecture designs of the SuperNets and their routing policies.\n\\noindent\\textbf{1) Path selection in multi-branch structures.} The simplest dynamic routing can be implemented by selectively executing \\emph{one} of multiple candidate modules at each layer , which is equivalent to producing a one-hot probability distribution $\\alpha_{s\\rightarrow \\cdot}^{\\ell}$ in Eq. \\ref{eq_supernet}. The main difference of this approach to hard MoE (\\figurename~\\ref{multi_branch} (b)) is that only one branch is activated without any fusion operations.\n\\noindent\\textbf{2) Neural trees and tree-structured networks.} \nAs decision trees always perform inference along one forward path that is dependent on input properties, combining tree structure with neural networks can naturally enjoy the adaptive inference paradigm and the representation power of DNNs simultaneously. Note that in a tree structure, the outputs of different nodes are routed to \\emph{independent} paths rather than being \\emph{fused} as in MoE structures (compare \\figurename~\\ref{multi_branch} (b), (c)).\na) \\emph{Soft decision tree} (SDT)  adopts neural units as routing nodes (blue nodes in \\figurename~\\ref{multi_branch} (c)), which decides the portion that the inputs are assigned to their left/right sub-tree. Each leaf node generates a probability distribution over the output space, and the final prediction is the expectation of the results from all leaf nodes. Although the probability for a sample reaching each leaf node in an SDT is data-dependent, all the paths are still executed, which limits the inference efficiency.\nb) \\emph{Neural trees with deterministic routing policies}  are designed to make hard routing decisions during inference, avoiding computation on those unselected paths.\nc) \\emph{Tree-structured DNNs.} Instead of developing decision trees containing neural units, a line of work builds special network architectures to endow them with the routing behavior of decision trees. For instance, a small CNN is first executed to classify each sample into coarse categories, and specific sub-networks are conditionally activated based on the coarse predictions . A subsequent work  not only partitions samples to different sub-networks, but also divides and routes the feature channels.\nDifferent to those networks using neural units only in routing nodes , or routing each sample to pre-designed sub-networks , adaptive neural tree (ANT)  adopts CNN modules as feature transformers in a hard neural tree (see lines with arrows in \\figurename~\\ref{multi_branch} (c)), and learns the tree structure together with the network parameters simultaneously in the training stage.\n\\noindent\\textbf{3) Others.} \n{Performing dynamic routing within more general SuperNet architectures is also a recent research trend.

However, only $\\sim\\!1/N$ times of computation is consumed in the latter approach.\nWeight adjustment could also be achieved by performing soft attention over the \\emph{spatial locations} of convolutional weights . For example, segmentation-aware convolutional network  applies locally masked convolution to aggregate information with larger weights from similar pixels, which are more likely to belong to the same object.\nUnlike  that requires a sub-network for feature embedding, pixel-adaptive convolution (PAC)  adapts the convolutional weights based on the attention mask generated from the input feature at each layer.\n{Instead of adjusting weights conditioned on every sample itself, meta-neighborhoods  adapt the network parameters to each input sample based on its similarity to the neighbors stored in a dictionary.}\n\\noindent\\textbf{2) Kernel shape adaptation.} \nApart from adaptively scaling the weight \\emph{values}, parameter adjustment can also be realized to reshape the convolutional kernels and achieve \\emph{dynamic reception of fields}. Towards this direction, \ndeformable convolutions  sample feature pixels from adaptive locations when performing convolution on each pixel. Deformable kernels  samples weights in the kernel space to adapt the \\emph{effective} reception field (ERF) while leaving the reception field unchanged.

A more straightforward solution is rescaling the features with input-dependent soft attention (see \\figurename~\\ref{dynamic_params} (c)), which requires minor modifications on computational graphs. Note that for a linear transformation $\\mathcal{F}$, applying attention $\\bm{\\alpha}$ on the output is equivalent to performing computation with re-weighted parameters, i.e.\n\\begin{equation}\\label{dynamic_feature_key}\n  \\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{3pt}\n    \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\Theta})\\otimes \\bm{\\alpha}= \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x},\\bm{\\Theta}\\otimes\\bm{\\alpha}).\n    \\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{3pt}\n\\end{equation}\n\\noindent\\textbf{1) Channel-wise attention} is one of the most common soft attention mechanisms.

It is found that the three forms yield different performance in different backbone networks.\n\\noindent\\textbf{2) Spatial-wise attention}. Spatial locations in features could also be dynamically rescaled with attention to improve the representation power of deep models . Instead of using pooling operations to efficiently gather global information as in channel-wise attention, convolutions are often adopted in spatial-wise attention to encode local information. Moreover, these two types of attention modules can be integrated in one framework  (see \\figurename~\\ref{dynamic_params} (c)).\n\\noindent\\textbf{3) Dynamic activation functions.} The aforementioned approaches to generating dynamic features usually apply soft attention before static activation functions. A recent line of work has sought to increase the representation power of models with dynamic activation functions . For instance, \nDY-ReLU  replaces ReLU $(\\mathbf{y}_c\\! =\\!\\max (\\mathbf{x}_c, 0))$ with the max value among $N$ linear transformations $\\mathbf{y}_c\\! =\\!\\max_{n} \\left\\{a_c^n \\mathbf{x}_c + b_c^n\\right\\}$, where $c$ is the channel index, and $a_c^n, b_c^n$ are linear coefficients calculated from $\\mathbf{x}$. On many vision tasks, these dynamic activation functions can effectively improve the performance of different network architectures with negligible computational overhead.\nTo summarize, soft attention has been exploited in many fields due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Moreover, it can be incorporated with other methods conveniently. E.g., by replacing the weighting scalar $\\alpha_n$ in Eq. \\ref{eq_moe} with channel-wise  or spatial-wise  attention, the output of multiple branches with independent kernel sizes  or feature resolutions  are adaptively fused.\nNote that we leave out the detailed discussion on the self attention mechanism, which is widely studied in both NLP  and CV fields  to re-weight features based on the similarity between queries and keys at different locations (temporal or spatial). \nReaders who are interested in this topic may refer to review studies .

In fact, theories for a deep understanding of current dynamic learning models and further improving them in principled ways are highly valuable. {Notably, it has been proven that a dynamic network with an adaptive width can preserve the representation power of an unsparsified model .} However, there are more theoretical problems that are fundamental for dynamic networks. Here we list several of them as follows.\n\\noindent\\textbf{1) Optimal decision in dynamic networks.}\nAn essential operation in most dynamic networks (especially those designed for improving computational efficiency) is making data-dependent decisions, e.g., determining whether a module should be evaluated or skipped. Existing solutions either use confidence-based criteria, or introduce policy networks and gating functions. Although being effective in practice (as mentioned in Sec. \\ref{inference_and_train}), they may not be optimal and lack theoretical justifications. Take early exiting as an example, the current heuristic methods  might face the issues of overconfidence, high sensitivity for threshold setting and poor transferability. As for policy networks or gating modules, runtime decisions can be made based on a learned function.\nHowever, they often introduce extra computations, and usually require a long and unstable training procedure. Therefore, principled approaches with theoretical guarantees for decision function design in dynamic networks is a valuable research topic.\n\\noindent\\textbf{2) Generalization issues.} \nIn a dynamic model, a sub-network might be activated for a set of test samples that are not uniformly sampled from the data distribution, e.g., smaller sub-networks tend to handle ``easy'' samples, while larger sub-networks are used for ``hard'' inputs . This brings a divergence between the training data distribution and that of the inference stage, and thus violates the common \\emph{i.i.d.} assumption in classical machine learning. Therefore, it would be interesting to develop new theories to analyze the generalization properties of dynamic networks under such distribution mismatch. Note that transfer learning also aims to address the issue of distributional shift at test time, but the samples of the target domain are assumed to be accessible in advance. In contrast, for dynamic models, the test distribution is not available until the training process is finished, when the network architecture and parameters are finalized.

Although many efforts, e.g., spatially adaptive models  and soft attention based models , have been made to address this issue, it remains a challenging problem to develop a unified and elegant dynamic network that can serve as an off-the-shelf backbone for a variety of tasks.\n\\vspace{-1.5ex}", "cites": [7281, 675, 7268, 674, 676], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8333333333333334, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes several relevant papers to highlight a common challenge: the limited applicability of dynamic neural networks beyond classification.

Therefore, we usually observe that the practical runtime of dynamic models lags behind the theoretical efficiency. For example, some spatially adaptive networks involve sparse computation, {which is known to be inefficient on modern computing devices due to the memory access bottleneck . A recent line of work focuses on the codesign of algorithm and hardware for accelerating deep models on platforms with more flexibility such as FPGA . Many input-dependent operations, including pixel-level dynamic computation , adaptive channel pruning  and early exiting , have also been tailored together with hardware for further improving their practical efficiency. It is an interesting research direction to simultaneously optimize the algorithm, hardware and deep learning libraries to harvest the theoretical efficiency gains of dynamic networks.}\n{In addition, a data-dependent inference procedure, especially for the dynamic \\emph{architectures}, usually requires a model to handle input samples sequentially, which also poses challenge for parallel computation. Although inference with batches has been enabled for early-exiting networks , the conflict between adaptive computational graph and parallel computation still exists for other types of dynamic architectures. This issue is mitigated in the scenario of mobile/edge computing, where the input signal by itself is sequential and the computing hardware is less powerful than high-end platforms. However, designing dynamic networks that are more compatible with existing hardware and software is still a valuable and challenging topic.}\n\\vspace{-1.5ex}", "cites": [721, 788, 7281], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes the cited papers by connecting algorithm-hardware co-design (Papers 1 and 2) with spatially adaptive computation (Paper 3) to explain the inefficiency of dynamic models on current hardware.
