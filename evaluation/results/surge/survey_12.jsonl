However, due to the huge quantity of data, the ImageNet-scale dataset was necessarily annotated by distributed workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk~\\footnote{\\url{https://www.mturk.com/}}. Due to the limited knowledge, distributed workers cannot annotate specific tasks with 100\\% accuracy, which naturally brings noisy labels. Another vivid example locates in medical applications, where datasets are typically small. However, it requires domain expertise to label medical data, which often suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability, leading to noisy labels. We should notice that, noisy labels will cause wrong model predictions, which might further influence decisions that impact human health negatively. Lastly, noisy labels are ubiquitous in speech domains, e.g., Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) calls~. In particular, due to unstable network conditions, VoIP calls are easily prone to various speech impairments, which should involve the user feedback to identify the cause. Such user feedback can be viewed as the cause labels, which are highly noisy, since most of users lack the domain expertise to accurately articulate the impairment in the perceived speech.\nAll the above noisy cases stem from our daily life, which cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is urgent to build up a robust learning algorithm for handling noisy labels with theoretical guarantees. In this survey paper, we term such a robust learning paradigm \\emph{label-noise learning}, and the noisy training data $(x,\\bar{y})$ is sampled from a corrupted distribution $p(X,\\bar{Y})$, where we assume that the features are intact but the labels are corrupted.\nAs far as we know, label-noise learning spans over two important ages in machine learning: statistical learning (i.e., shallow learning) and representation learning (i.e., deep learning). In the age of statistical learning, label-noise learning focused on designing noise-tolerant losses or unbiased risk estimators~. However, in the age of representation learning, label-noise learning has more options to combat with noisy labels, such as designing biased risk estimators or leveraging memorization effects of deep networks~.", "cites": [3340, 4451], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2857142857142857, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of label-noise learning, synthesizing insights from cited papers and real-world examples to establish a narrative on its importance and evolution.

There are two reasons behind. First, from the essence of the learning paradigm, deep supervised learning requires a lot of well-labeled data, which may require too much cost, especially for many start-ups. However, deep unsupervised learning (even self-supervised learning) is too immature to work very well in complex real-world scenarios. Therefore, as deep weakly-supervised learning, label-noise representation learning naturally has attracted much attention and has become a hot topic. Second, from the aspect of data, many real-world scenarios lack purely clean annotations, such as financial data, web data, and biomedical data. These have directly motivated researchers to explore label-noise representation learning.\nAs far as we know, there indeed exist three pioneer surveys related to label noise. \nFrenay and Verleysen~ focused on discussing label-noise statistical learning, \ninstead of label-noise representation learning.\nAlthough Algan et al.~ and Karimi et al.~ focused on deep learning with noisy labels, \nboth of them only considered image (or medical image) classification tasks. \nMoreover, their surveys were written from the applied perspective, instead of discussing methodology and its beneath theory.\nTo compensate for them and go beyond, we want to contribute to the label-noise representation learning area as follows.\n\\footnote{An update-to-date list of papers related to label-noise representation learning is here: \\url{https://github.com/bhanML/label-noise-papers}.}\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\n\\item From the perspective of machine learning, we give the formal definition for label-noise representation learning (LNRL). \nThe definition is not only general enough to include the existing LNRL, but also specific enough to clarify what the goal of LNRL is and how we can solve it.\n\\item Via the lens of learning theory, \nwe provide a deeper understanding why noisy labels affect the performance of deep models. \nMeanwhile, we report the generalization of deep models under noisy labels, which coincides with our theoretical understanding.\n\\item We perform extensive literature review from the age of representation learning, \nand categorize them in a unified taxonomy in terms of data, objective and optimization. \nThe pros and cons of different categories are analyzed. \nWe also present a summary of insights for each category.\n\\item Based on the above observations, we can spark new directions in label-noise representation learning.

In 1988, Angluin et al.~ proved that a learning algorithm can handle incorrect training examples robustly, when the noise rate is less than one half under the random noise model. Lawrence and Sch\\\"olkopf~ constructed a kernel Fisher discriminant to formulate the label-noise problem as a probabilistic model. Bartlett et al.~ justified that most loss functions are not completely robust to label noise. This means that classifiers based on label-noise learning algorithms are still affected by label noise.\nDuring this period, a lot of works emerged and contributed to this area. For example, Crammer et al.~ proposed the online Passive-Aggressive perceptron algorithm to cope with label noise. Natarajan et al.~ formally formulated an unbiased risk estimator for binary classification with noisy labels. This work was very important to the area, since it is the first work to provide guarantees for risk minimization under random label noise. Meanwhile, Scott et al.~ studied the classification problem under the class-conditional noise model, and proposed a way to handle asymmetric label noise. In contrast, van Rooyen et al.~ proposed the unhinge loss to tackle symmetric label noise. Liu and Tao~ proposed a method using anchor points to estimate the noise rate, and further leveraged importance reweighting to design surrogate loss functions for class-conditional label noise.\nIn 2015, research of label-noise learning has been shifted from statistical learning to representation learning, since deep learning models have become a mainstream due to its better empirical performance.

For example, Sukhbaatar et al.~ introduced an extra but constrained linear ``noise'' layer on top of the softmax layer, which adapts the network outputs to model the noisy label distribution. Reed et al.~ augmented the prediction objective with the notion of consistency via soft and hard bootstrapping. Intuitively, this bootstrapping procedure provides the learner to disagree with an inconsistent training label, and re-label the training data to improve its label quality. Azadi et al.~ proposed an auxiliary image regularization technique, which exploits the mutual context information among training data, and encourages the model to select reliable labels.\nFollowing the seminal works, Goldberger et al.~ introduced a nonlinear ``noise'' adaptation layer on top of the softmax layer. Patrini et al.~ proposed the forward and backward loss correction approaches simultaneously. Both Wang et al.~ and Ren et al.~ leveraged the same philosophy, namely data reweighting, to learn with label noise. Jiang et al.~ is the first to leverage small-loss tricks to handle label noise. However, they trained only a single network iteratively, which inherits the accumulated error. To alleviate this, Han et al.~ trained two deep neural networks, and each network backpropagated the data selected by its peer network and updated itself.\nIn the context of representation learning, classical methods, such as estimating the noise transition matrix, regularization and designing losses, are still prosperous for handling label noise. For instance, Hendrycks et al.~ leveraged trusted examples to estimate the gold transition matrix, which approximates the true transition matrix well. Han et al.~ proposed a ``human-in-the-loop'' idea to easily estimate the transition matrix.

Under the criterion of balanced error rate (BER) minimization, Charoenphakdee et al.~ proposed the barrier hinge loss. In contrast to selected samples via small-loss tricks, Thulasidasan et al.~ introduced the abstention-based training, which allows deep networks to abstain from learning on confusing samples but to learn on non-confusing samples.

Note that it is impossible to annotate such large-scale data individually, which motivates us to leverage crowdsourcing technique (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk). However, the quality of crowdsourced data is normally low with a certain degree of label noise. Therefore, an important task ($T$) is to robustly training deep neural networks with crowdsourced data ($E$), and the trained deep models can be evaluated via the test accuracy ($P$).\n\\item \\textit{Healthcare}: Healthcare is highly related to each individual, whose data requires machine learning technique to analyze deeply and intelligently. However, intelligent healthcare ($T$) requires domain expertise to label medical data first, which often suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability, leading to noisy medical data ($E$). We should notice that, noisy labels will cause a high error rate ($P$) of deep model predictions, which might further influence decisions that impact human health negatively.\n\\item \\textit{Speech}: In the speech recognition task (e.g., Apple Siri), the machine learning program can improve its recognition accuracy via training with a large-scale speech data set offline. However, noisy labels are ubiquitous in speech domains, e.g., the task of rating for service calls ($T$). Due to the difference of the personal mood and understanding, service calls are easily prone to different rating ($E$) for the same service. Such rating can be viewed as labels, which are highly noisy since most of users lack the domain expertise to accurately rate the speech service. Therefore, it is critical to robustly train deep neural networks with the user rating ($E$), and evaluate the trained model via the quality rate of service calls ($P$).\n\\end{itemize}\nAs noisy supervised information related to $T$ is directly contained in $E$, it is quite natural that common deep supervised learning approaches will fail on LNRL problems. One of the recent findings (i.e., memorization effects~) in the deep learning area may explain this: due to the high model capacity, deep neural networks will eventually fit and memorize label noise.

Most importantly, one of the key components in MixMatch is Minimum Entropy Regularization (MER), which belongs to explicit regularization in LNRL. Speicifically, MER was proposed by Grandvalet \\& Bengio~, and the key idea is to augment the cross-entropy loss with an explicit term encouraging the classifier to make predictions with high confidence on the unlabeled examples, namely minimizing the model entropy  \nfor unlabeled data $x$. Similar to MER, the pseudo-label method conducts entropy minimization implicitly~, which generates hard labels from high-confidence predictions on unlabeled data for further training. In particular, the pseudo-label method (i.e., label guessing) first computes the average of the model’s predicted class distributions across all augmentations, and then applies a temperature sharpening function to reduce the entropy of the label distribution.\nMiyato et al.~ also explored the smoothness for combating label noise, and they proposed the virtual adversarial loss, which is a new measure of local smoothness of the conditional label distribution given input. Specifically, their method enforces the output distribution to be isotropically smooth around each input data \nvia selectively smoothing the model in its most anisotropic direction. The\nbenefit of such smoothness makes the model output insensitive  to the input data. To realize such smoothness, they first design the virtual adversarial direction, which can greatly deviate from the current inferred output distribution, from the status quo without the label information. Based on such a direction, they defined local distributional smoothness, and then proposed a training method called virtual adversarial training (VAT).\nMathematically, \nthey first defined local distributional smoothness (LDS):\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{LDS}(x^*,\\theta):=D[p(y|x^*,\\hat{\\theta}),p(y|x^*+r_{\\text{vadv}},\\theta)],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n$r_{\\text{vadv}}\n:= \\arg\\max\\nolimits_{\\left\\lVert r \\right\\rVert_2 \\leq \\epsilon} \nD[ p(y|x^*,\\hat{\\theta}),p(y|x^*+r) ]$,\n$D$ is a non-negative function that measures the distribution divergence, and\n$x^*$ represents either labeled or unlabeled features.

In the\nhigh-level, this provides the learner justification to ``disagree'' with a\nperceptually-inconsistent training label, and effectively re-label the data.\nNamely, the learner bootstraps itself in this way, which uses a convex\ncombination of training labels and the current model’s predictions to generate\nthe training targets. Intuitively, as the learner improves over time, its\npredictions can be trusted more. Such bootstrapping can avoid modeling the noise\ndistribution. Specifically, Reed et al.~ proposed two ways\nto realize bootstrapping, such as soft and hard bootstrapping. The soft version\nloss $\\ell_{\\text{soft}}$ uses predicted class probabilities $q$ directly to\ngenerate regression targets for each batch as follows:\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ell_{\\text{soft}}(q,t) \n= \\sum\\nolimits_{k=1}^{L}[\\beta t_k + (1-\\beta)q_k]\\log(q_k),\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $t$ denotes the training labels.\nThe parameter $\\beta$ balances the prediction $q$ and target $t$, which can be found via cross validation. The soft version loss is equivalent to softmax regression with minimum entropy regularization, which encourages the model to have a high confidence in predicting labels. Meanwhile, the hard version loss $\\ell_{\\text{hard}}$ modifies targets using a MAP estimate of $q$ given $\\mathbf{x}$ as follows:\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ell_{\\text{hard}}(q,t) \n= \\sum\\nolimits_{k=1}^{L}[\\beta t_k + (1-\\beta)z_k]\\log(q_k),\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $z_k = \\mathbf{1}[k=\\arg\\max_{i = 1,\\ldots,L} q_i]$ and $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot]$ denotes the indicator function. To solve the hard version via stochastic gradient descent, an EM-like method will be employed.

In the M-step, the model parameters are updated in order to predict those generated targets better.\n\\item Mixup~: Motivated by vicinal risk minimization~, Zhang et al.~ introduced a data-agnostic regularization method called Mixup, which constructs virtual training examples $(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y})$ as follows.\n\\begin{equation}\\label{mixup}\n\\tilde{x} = \\lambda x_i + (1-\\lambda)x_j\n\\;\\text{and}\\;\n\\tilde{y} = \\lambda y_i + (1-\\lambda)y_j,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$ are two examples randomly drawn from the training data and $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ is a balanced parameter between two examples.\nIntuitively, Mixup conducts virtual data augmentation, \nwhich dilutes the noise effects and smooths the data manifold. \nThis simple but effective idea can be used in not only noisy labels but also adversarial examples, \nsince the smoothness happens in both features and labels according to \\eqref{mixup}.\n\\item SIGUA~: It is noted that, given data with noisy labels, \nover-parameterized deep networks can gradually fit the whole data~.\nTo relieve this issue, \nHan et al.~ proposed a gradient-ascent method called stochastic integrated gradient underweighted ascent (SIGUA): \nin a mini-batch, \nwe adopt gradient descent on good data as usual, and learning-rate-reduced gradient ascent on bad data; \nthe proposal is a versatile approach where data goodness or badness is w.r.t. desired or undesired memorization given a base learning method.\nTechnically, SIGUA is a specially designed regularization by pulling optimization back for generalization when their goals conflict with each other.\nA key difference between SIGUA and parameter shrinkage like weight decay is that SIGUA pulls optimization back on some data but parameter shrinkage does the same on all data; philosophically, SIGUA shows that forgetting undesired memorization can reinforce desired one, which provides a novel viewpoint on the inductive bias of neural networks.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [4139, 3630, 4115, 4457, 7191], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7142857142857143, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key implicit regularization techniques from multiple papers (Bootstrapping, Mixup, SIGUA) and integrates them under a common theme of mitigating label noise through model self-correction or data manipulation.

Their designs are based on different principles, such as gradient clipping~ and curriculum learning~. \nHere, we choose several representative losses to explain.\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\n\\item Zhang et al.~ proposed a generalized cross-entropy loss called $\\ell_q$, which encompasses both the mean absolute error\n(MAE) and categorical cross entropy (CCE) loss. Since the $\\ell_q$ loss is a generalization of MAE and CCE, it enjoys the benefits of both the noise-robustness provided by MAE and the implicit weighting scheme of CCE, which can be well justified by theoretical analysis.\nMore importantly, it empirically works well for both closed-set noise~ and open-set noise~.\nMathematically, they used the negative Box-Cox transformation as a \n$\\ell_q$ loss function: \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\ell_q(f(x),e_j) = (1-f_j(x)^q) / q,\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $q \\in (0,1]$ and $e_j$ is one-hot vector belonging to ghe $j$-th class. The $\\ell_q$ loss is reduced to CCE when\n$\\lim_{q\\rightarrow0}\\ell_q(f(x),e_j)$, and becomes MAE when $q = 1$. Since a\ntighter bound in $\\ell_q$ can bring stronger noise tolerance due to discarding many samples for training, they proposed the truncated $\\ell_q$ loss:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\ell_\\text{trunc}(f(x),e_j)\n=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\ell_q(k) & \\text{if} \\; f_j(x) \\leq k, \\\\\n\\ell_q(f(x),e_j) & \\text{otherwise}, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $0 < k < 1$, and $\\ell_q(k) = \\nicefrac{1-k^q}{q}$. When $k \\rightarrow 0$, the truncated $\\ell_q$ loss equals the original $\\ell_q$ loss.\n\\item\nCharoenphakdee et al.~ theoretically justified symmetric losses through the lens of theoretical tools, including the classification-calibration condition, excess risk bound, conditional risk minimizer and AUC-consistency. The key idea is to design a loss that does not have to satisfy the symmetric condition everywhere, which gives a high penalty in the non-symmetric area,\ni.e., $\\ell(z) + \\ell(-z)$ is a constant for every $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Motivated by this phenomenon, they introduced a barrier hinge loss, satisfying a symmetric condition not everywhere but gives a large penalty once $z$ is outside of the symmetric interval,\nwhich incentivizes to learn a prediction function inside of the symmetric interval. \nMathematically, a barrier hinge loss is defined as follows.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\ell(z) = \\max(-b(r+z)+r,\\max(b(z-r),r-z)),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $b > 1$ and $r > 0$.\n\\item\nThulasidasan et al.~ proposed to abstain some confusing examples during training deep networks. \nIn practice, abstention has some relation with loss redesign. Based on abstention, they introduced a deep abstaining classifier (DAC). \nDAC has an additional output $p_{k+1}$, which indicates the probability of abstention.\nThe loss of DAC is as follows.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\ell(x_j) \n= - \\tilde{p}_{k + 1} \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^k t_i\\log( \\nicefrac{p_i}{\\tilde{p}_{k + 1}} )\n- \\alpha\\log \\tilde{p}_{k + 1},  \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\tilde{p}_{k + 1} = 1-p_{k+1}$. If $\\alpha$ is large, the penalty drives $p_{k+1}$ to zero, which leads the model not to abstain. If $\\alpha$ is small, the classifier may abstain on everything. They further proposed an auto-tuning algorithm to find the optimal $\\alpha$. Note that DAC can be used for both structured (e.g., asymmetric and pair-flipping) and unstructured (i.e., symmetric) label noise, where DAC works as a data cleaner.\n\\item\nAditya et al.~ leveraged gradient clipping to design a new loss. \nIntuitively, clipping the gradient prevents over-confident descent steps in the scenario of label noise. Motivated by gradient clipping, they proposed the partially Huberized loss\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tilde{\\ell}_{\\theta}(x,y)\n\\! = \\!\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\tau p_{\\theta}(x,y)\n\\! + \\! \\log\\tau \\! + \\! 1 & \\text{if} \\; p_{\\theta}(x,y) \\leq \\frac{1}{\\tau}, \n\\\\\n-\\log p_{\\theta}(x,y) & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n\\item\nLyu et al.~ proposed the curriculum loss (CL), which is a tighter \nupper bound of the 0-1 loss compared to the conventional surrogate of the 0-1 loss (cf. Eq. (8) in ). Moreover, CL can adaptively select samples for stagewise training. In particular, giving any base loss function $\\ell(u) \\geq \\mathbf{1} (u < 0), u \\in \\mathbb{R}$, CL is defined as follows.\n\\begin{align*}\nQ(\\mathbf{u}) \n=\n\\max\n\\left( \n\\min\\nolimits_{\\mathbf{v}\\in\\{0,1\\}^n} f_1(\\mathbf{v})\n,\n\\min\\nolimits_{\\mathbf{v}\\in\\{0,1\\}^n} f_2(\\mathbf{v})\n\\right),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere\n\\begin{align*}\nf_1(\\mathbf{v}) \n\\! = \\! \\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\\ell(u_i)\n\\;\\text{and}\\;\nf_2(\\mathbf{v})\n\\! = \\! n \\! - \\! \\sum_{i=1}^n v_i \\! + \\! \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{1}(u_i \\! < \\! 0).\n\\end{align*}\nTo adapt CL for deep learning models, they further introduced the noise pruned CL.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [4130, 3340, 4182, 8630, 7781], "cite_extract_rate": 0.625, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of loss redesign approaches for label-noise robustness, connecting ideas from multiple papers (e.g., Zhang, Charoenphakdee, Thulasidasan, Aditya, Lyu).

The key idea of self-ensembling is to form a consensus prediction of the unknown labels using the outputs of the network in training. Specifically, the $\\pi$-model encourages consistent network output between two realizations of the same input, under two different dropout conditions. \nBeyond the $\\pi$-model, temporal ensembling is considered for the network predictions over multiple previous training epochs. \nThe loss function of the $\\pi$-model is\n\\begin{equation}\n\\ell = -\\nicefrac{1}{B}\\sum\\nolimits_i\n\\log z_i[y_i] + \\nicefrac{w(t)}{C|B|}\n\\sum\\nolimits_i \\left\\|z_i-\\tilde{z}_i\\right\\|^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the first term handles labeled data via the standard cross-entropy loss, namely, $\\log z_i[y_i]$ calculates the cross-entropy loss value between model prediction $z_i$ and label $y_i$, and the second term handles unlabeled data. Note that $(x_i,y_i)$ denotes the pair of input and label, $B$ denotes the mini-batch size, and $C$ denotes the number of different classes. Both $z_i$ and $\\tilde{z}_i$ are transformed from the same input $x_i$, namely two predictions via the same network with different dropout conditions. The second term is also scaled by time-dependent weighting function $w(t)$. Temporal ensembling goes beyond $\\pi$-model by aggregating the predictions of multiple previous network evaluations into an ensemble prediction. Namely, the main difference from $\\pi$-model is that the network and augmentations are evaluated only once per input in each epoch, and the target $\\tilde{z}$ is based on prior network evaluations. \nAfter every training epoch, \nthe network outputs $z_i$ are accumulated into ensemble outputs $Z_i$ by updating $Z_i \\leftarrow \\alpha Z_i + (1-\\alpha)z_i$ and $\\tilde{z} \\leftarrow \\nicefrac{Z_i}{(1-\\alpha^t)}$, where $\\alpha$ is a momentum term.\n\\item\nNguyen et al.~ proposed a self-ensemble label filtering (SELF) method to progressively filter out the wrong labels during training. \nIn high-level, they leveraged the knowledge provided in the network's output over different training iterations to form a consensus of predictions, which progressively identifies and filters out the noisy labels from the labeled data. In the filtering strategy, the model can determine the set of potentially corrected samples $L_i$ based on agreement between the label $y$ and its maximum likelihood prediction $\\hat{y}_x$ with $L_i = \\{(y,x)|\\hat{y}_x = y; \\forall (y,x) \\in L_0\\}$,\nwhere $L_0$ is the sample set \nin the beginning. In the self-ensemble strategy, they maintained the two-level ensemble. First, they leveraged the model ensemble with Mean Teacher~, \nnamely an exponential running average of model snapshots. Second, they employed a\nprediction ensemble by collecting the sample predictions over multiple training\nepochs: $\\bar{z}_j = \\alpha \\bar{z}_{j-1} + (1-\\alpha)\\hat{z}_j$, where\n$\\bar{z}_j$ depicts the moving-average prediction of sample $k$ at epoch $j$ and\n$\\hat{z}_j$ is the model prediction for sample $k$ at epoch $j$.\n\\item\nMa et al.~ \ninvestigated the dimensionality of the deep representation subspace of training samples. \nThen, they developed a dimensionality-driven learning strategy, \nwhich monitors the dimensionality of subspaces during training and adapts the loss function accordingly. The key idea is to leverage the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID), which discriminates clean labels and noisy labels during training deep networks.\nMathematically, the estimation of LID can be defined as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{\\text{LID}} \n= -\n\\big( \\nicefrac{1}{k}\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^k\\log\\nicefrac{r_i(x)}{r_{\\max}(x)}\\big)^{-1},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $r_i(x)$ denotes the distance between $x$ and its $i$-th nearest neighbor, and $r_{\\max}(x)$ denotes the maximum of the neighbor distance. Specifically, when learning with clean labels, the LID score is consistently decreasing and the test accuracy is increasing with the increase of training epochs. However, when learning with noisy labels, the LID score first decreases and then increases after a few epochs. In contrast, the test accuracy is totally opposite, which first increases and then decreases. Based on the LID score, the dynamics of deep networks is overseen.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [3342, 7162, 199], "cite_extract_rate": 0.75, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"error": "Failed to parse LLM response", "raw_response": "{\n    \"type\": \"analytical\",\n    \"scores\": {\"synthesis\": 3.5, \"critical\": 2.5, \"abstraction\": 3.0},\n    \"insight_level\": \"medium\",\n    \"analysis\": \"The section provides an analytical overview of label ensemble methods by connecting ideas from multiple papers, particularly linking self-ensembling and label filtering strategies.

Namely, they performed validation at every training iteration to dynamically determine the example weights of the current batch.

However, such a rate is critical in training deep networks. \nSpecifically, Yao et al.~ designed a domain-specific search and proposed\na novel Newton algorithm to solve the bi-level optimization problem efficiently. \nTo explore the optimal rate $R(\\cdot)$, they formulated the problem as\n\\begin{align*}\nR^* & = \\arg\\min\\nolimits_{R(\\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{val}}(f(w^*;R),\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{val}})\n\\\\\n\\text{s.t.} \\;\n& w^* = \\arg\\min\\nolimits_{w} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{tr}}(f(w^*;R),\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{tr}}),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}$ is the search space of $R(\\cdot)$ exploring a general pattern of the memorization effect. \nSuch a prior on $\\mathcal{F}$ not only allows \nefficient bi-level optimization\nbut also boosts the final learning performance. \n\\item\nMotivated by MixMatch,\nLi et al.~ promoted a novel framework termed DivideMix by leveraging semi-supervised learning techniques. \nIn high-level, DivideMix used a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to dynamically\ndivides the training data into two parts. The first part includes labeled data\nwith clean labels; while the second part includes unlabeled data with noisy\nlabels. During the semi-supervised learning phase, they leveraged variants of\nCo-training, such as Co-refinement~ on labeled data and\nCo-guessing~ on unlabeled data. Specifically, once the data is divided into labeled and unlabeled data, they conducted Co-refinement for labeled data, which linearly combines the ground-truth label with the network's prediction and sharpens the refined label. Then they conducted Co-guessing for unlabeled data, which averages the predictions from both networks. After Co-refinement and Co-guessing, they followed the routine MixMatch to mix the data, and updated the model parameters.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [4126, 7778, 4253], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section integrates multiple works (Chen et al., Yao et al., Li et al.) by connecting their contributions to the broader theme of improving Co-teaching with noisy labels.

Intuitively, this noise is quite realistic, as poor-quality or ambiguous instances are more likely to be mislabeled in real-world datasets. However, it is much more complex to formulate the IDN model, since the probability of a mislabeled instance is a function of not only the label space but also the input space that can be very high-dimensional. Moreover, without some extra assumptions/information, IDN is unidentifiable~.\nTowards the IDN model, there are several seminal explorations. For instance, Menon et al.~ proposed the boundary-consistent noise model, which considers stronger noise for samples closer to the decision boundary of the Bayes optimal classifier. However, this model is restricted to binary classification and cannot estimate noise functions. Cheng et al.~ recently studied a particular case of the IDN model, in which the noise functions are upper-bounded. Nonetheless, their method is limited to binary classification and has only been tested on small datasets. Berthon et al.~ proposed to tackle the IDN model from the new perspective, by considering confidence scores to be available for the label of each instance. They term this new setting confidence-scored IDN (CSIDN). Based on CSIDN, they derived an instance-level forward correction algorithm.

In other words, would it be more useful to consider the scenario in which the features are adversarially perturbed while the labels are noisy? We term this adversarial LNRL.\nTowards adversarial LNRL, there are two seminal works. For example, Wang et al.~ proposed a new defense algorithm called misclassification aware adversarial training (MART), which explicitly differentiates the misclassified examples (i.e., label noise) and correctly classified examples during  training. To address this issue, MART introduces misclassification aware regularization, namely $1/n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbf{1}(h_{\\theta}(x_i)\\neq h_{\\theta}(\\hat{x}'_i))\\cdot\\mathbf{1}(h_{\\theta}(x_i)\\neq y_i)$, where $h_{\\theta}$ denotes a DNN classifer with model parameter $\\theta$, $(x_i, y_i) $ denotes the $i$th pair of features and label, and $\\hat{x}'_i$ denotes the adversarial example generated by (5) in . Intuitively, $\\mathbf{1}(h_{\\theta}(x_i)\\neq y_i)$ denotes the misclassified examples, which can be closely connected with label noise. Meanwhile, Zhang et al.~ considered the same issue, namely misclassified examples in adversarial training. Specifically, they proposed friendly adversarial training (FAT), which trains deep networks using the wrongly-predicted adversarial data minimizing the loss and the correctly-predicted adversarial data maximizing the loss. To realize FAT, they introduced early-stopped PGD. Namely, once the adversarial data is misclassified by the current model, they  stopped the PGD iterations early. In high-level, the objective of FAT is min-min optimization instead of min-max optimization in standard adversarial training.", "cites": [4471, 892], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes two seminal works on adversarial training with label noise, connecting their core idea of addressing misclassified examples during training.

However, we hope to explore the horizontal domain more, namely, noisy data instead of only noisy labels. Here, we summarize different formats of noisy data, and show some preliminary works.\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\n\\item \n\\textit{Feature}:\nNaturally, label noise can arouse us to consider feature noise, where the adversarial example is one of the special cases in feature noise~. The problem of feature noise is formulated as $p(\\bar{X}|Y)$, in which the features are corrupted but the labels are intact.\nTherefore, adversarial training can be the main tool to defend from adversarial examples. Note that there exists another feature noise called random perturbation~. To address this issue, Zhang et al.~ proposed a robust ResNet, which is motivated by dynamical systems. Specifically, they characterized ResNet based on an explicit Euler method. This allows us to exploit the step factor in the Euler method to control the robustness of ResNet. They  proved that a small step factor can benefit its training and generalization robustness during backward and forward propagation. Namely, controlling the step factor robustifies deep networks, which can alleviate feature noise.\n\\item \\textit{Preference}:\nHan et al.~ and Pan et al.~ tried to address preference noise in ranking problems,\nwhich plays an important role in our daily life, such as ordinal peer grading, online image-rating and online product recommendation.\nSpecifically, Han et al.~ proposed the ROPAL model, which integrates the Plackett-Luce model with a denoising vector. Based on the Kendall-tau distance, this vector corrects $k$-ary noisy preferences with a certain probability. However, ROPAL cannot handle the dynamic length of $k$-ary noisy preferences, which motivated Pan et al.~ to propose COUPLE, which leverages stagewise learning to break the limit of fixed length. To update the parameters of both models, they used online Bayesian inference.\n\\item \\textit{Domain}:\nDomain adaptation (DA) is one of the fundamental problems in machine learning, when the data volume in the target domain is scarce. Previous DA methods assume that labeled data in the source domain is  clean. However, in practice, labeled data in the source domain may come from amateur annotators or the Internet due to its large volume. This issue brings us a new setting, where labels in the source domain are noisy. We call this setting \\textit{wild domain adaptation (WDA)}.\nThere are two seminal works. Specifically, to handle WDA, Liu et al.~ proposed the Butterfly framework, \nwhich maintains four deep networks simultaneously. \nButterfly can obtain high-quality domain-invariant representations (DIR) and target-specific representations (TSR) in an iterative manner.\nMeanwhile, Yu et al.~ proposed a novel Denoising Conditional Invariant Component (DCIC) framework, \nwhich provably ensures extracting invariant representations and estimating the label distribution in the target domain with no bias.\n\\item \\textit{Similarity}:\nSimilarity-based learning~ is one of the emerging weakly-supervised problems, where similar data pairs (i.e., two examples belonging to the same class) and unlabeled data are available. Compared to class labels, similarity labels are easier to obtain, especially for some sensitive issues, e.g., religion and politics. For example, for sensitive matters, people often hesitate to directly answer ``What is your opinion on issue A?''; while they are more likely to answer ``With whom do you share the same opinion on issue A?''. Therefore, similarity labels are easier to obtain. However, for some cases, people may not be willing to provide their real thoughts even facing easy questions. Therefore, noisy-similarity-labeled data are very challenging. Wu et al.~ employed a noise transition matrix to model similarity noise, which has been integrated into a deep learning system.\n\\item \\textit{Graph}:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are very hot in the machine learning community~. \nHowever, are GNNs robust to noise? For example, once the node or edge is corrupted, the performance of GNNs will certainly deteriorate. Since GNNs are highly related to discrete and combinatorial optimization, LNRL methods cannot be directly deployed. Therefore, it is very meaningful to robustify GNNs under the node or edge noise, in which the noise can occur in labels and features. Recently, Wang et al.~ proposed a robust and unsupervised embedding framework called Cross-Graph, which can handle structural corruption in attributed graphs. Meanwhile, since Hendrycks et al.~ discovered that pre-training can improve  model robustness and uncertainty, we may leverage strategies for pre-training GNNs~ to overcome the issues of graph noise.\n\\item \\textit{Demonstration}:\nThe goal of imitation learning (IL) is to learn a good policy from high-quality demonstrations~. However, the quality of demonstrations in reality should be diverse, since it is easier and cheaper to collect demonstrations from a mix of experts and amateurs. This brings us a new setting of IL called diverse-quality demonstrations, where low-quality demonstrations are highly noisy~. When experts provide additional information about the quality, learning from diverse-quality demonstrations becomes relatively easy, since the quality can be estimated by their confidence scores~, ranking scores~ and a small number of high-quality demonstrations~. However, without the availability of experts, these methods may not work well. Recently, Tangkaratt et al.~ pushed forward this line, and proposed to model the quality with a probabilistic graphic model termed VILD. Specifically, they estimated the quality along with a reward function that represents an intention of experts' decision making. Moreover, they used a variational approach to handle large state-action spaces, and employed importance sampling to improve  data efficiency.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [7133, 892, 7824, 4473, 4475, 8795, 7007, 4474, 7335, 4472, 7825, 8696], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6, "origin_cites_number": 20, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by grouping related works under distinct types of noisy data (feature, preference, domain, similarity, graph, demonstration), and connecting them to broader LNRL challenges.

Starting from 1988, Angluin et al. proved that a learning algorithm can handle incorrect training examples robustly, when the noise rate is less than one half under the random noise model~. Bylander further demonstrated that linear threshold functions are polynomially learnable in the presence of classification noise~. Lawrence and Sch\\\"olkopf constructed a kernel Fisher discriminant to formulate label-noise problem as a probabilistic model~, which is solved by Expectation Maximization algorithm. Although the above works explored to tackle noisy labels theoretically and empirically, Bartlett et al. justified that most loss functions are not completely robust to label noise~. It means that classifiers based on label-noise robust algorithms are still affected by label noise.\nDuring this period, a lot of works emerged and contributed to this area. For example, Crammer et al. proposed an online Passive-Aggressive perceptron algorithm to cope with label noise~. Dredze et al. proposed confidence weighted learning to weigh trusted labels more~. Freund proposed a boosting algorithm to combat against random label noise~. To handle label noise theoretically, Cesa-Bianchi et al. proposed an online learning algorithm, leveraging unbiased estimates of the gradient of the loss~. Until 2013, Natarajan et al. formally formulated an unbiased risk estimator for binary classification with noisy labels~. This work is very important to the area, since it is the first work to provide guarantees for risk minimization under random label noise. Moreover, this work provides an easy way to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function for handling label noise.\nMeanwhile, Scott et al. studied the classification problem under class-conditional noise model, and propose the way to handle asymmetric label noise~. In contrast, van Rooyen et al. proposed the unhinge loss to tackle symmetric label noise~. Liu and Tao proposed the method of anchor points to estimate the noise rate, and further leverage importance reweighting to design surrogate loss functions for class-conditional label noise~. Instead of designing ad-hoc losses, Patrini et al. introduced linear-odd losses, which can be factorized into an even and an odd loss function~. More importantly, they estimated the mean operator from noisy data, and plug this operator in linear-odd losses for empirical risk minimization, which is resistant to asymmetric label noise.\nIt is noted that, we move from label-noise statistical learning to label-noise representation learning after 2015. There are two reasons behind this phenomenon. First, label-noise statistical learning mainly focus on designing theoretically-robust methods for small-scale noisy data. However, such methods cannot empirically work well on large-scale noisy data in our daily life, such as Clothing1M~ emerging from 2015. Second, label-noise statistical learning mainly applies to shallow and convex models, such as support vector machines. However, deep and non-convex models, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, have become trendy and mainstream due to the better empirical performance, not only in vision, but also in language, speech and video tasks. Therefore, it is urgent to design label-noise representation learning methods for robustly training of deep models with noisy labels.", "cites": [3454, 8734, 4119, 8796, 3453], "cite_extract_rate": 0.35714285714285715, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes a range of foundational works on label-noise statistical learning, connecting theoretical and empirical contributions into a coherent narrative.

For example, Sukhbaatar et al. introduced an extra but constrained linear ``noise'' layer on top of the softmax layer, which adapts the network outputs to model the noisy label distribution~. Reed et al. augmented the prediction objective with a notion of consistency via a soft and hard bootstrapping~, where the soft version is equivalent to softmax regression with minimum entropy regularization and the hard version modifies regression targets using the MAP estimation. Intuitively, this bootstrapping procedure provides the learner to disagree with an inconsistent training label, and re-label the training data to improve its label quality. Azadi et al. proposed an auxiliary image regularization technique~. The key idea is to exploit the mutual context information among training data, and encourage the model to select reliable labels.\nFollowed by seminal works, Goldberger et al. introduced a nonlinear ``noise'' adaptation layer on top of the softmax layer~, which adapts to model the noisy label distribution. Patrini et al. proposed forward and backward loss correction approaches simultaneously~. Based on the corrected loss, they explored a robust two-stage training algorithm. A very interesting point is, both Wang et al. and Ren et al. leveraged the same philosophy, namely data reweighting, to learn with label noise. However, they tackled from different perspectives. Specifically, Wang et al. come from a view of Bayesian and propose robust probabilistic modeling~, where the posterior of reweighted model will identify uncorrupted data but ignore corrupted data. Ren et al. come from a view of meta-learning~, which assigns weights to training samples based on their gradient directions. Namely, their method performs a meta gradient descent step on the current mini-batch example weights (initialized from zero) to minimize the loss on a clean unbiased validation set.\nBesides the above works, there are many important works born in 2018, ranging in diverse directions. In high-level, there are several major directions, such as estimating transition matrix, regularization, designing losses and small-loss tricks. Among them, small-loss tricks are inspired by memorization effects of deep neural networks, where deep models will fit easy (clean) patterns first but over-fit hard (noisy) patterns eventually. Namely, small-loss tricks regard small-loss samples as relatively ``clean'' samples, and back-propagate such samples to update the model parameters. For example, Jiang et al. is the first to leverage small-loss tricks to handle label noise~. However, they train only a single network iteratively, which is similar to the self-training approach. Such approach inherits the same inferiority of accumulated error caused by the sample-selection bias. To address this issue, Han et al. train two deep neural networks simultaneously, and back propagates the data selected by its peer network and updates itself~.\nIn the context of representation learning, estimating transition matrix, regularization and designing losses are still prosperous for handling label noise. For instance, given that a small set of trusted examples are available, Hendrycks et al. proposed gold loss correction. Namely, they leveraged trusted examples to estimate the (gold) transition matrix perfectly~. Therefore, on noisy examples, they will train deep models via forward correction (by gold matrix); on trusted examples, they will train deep models normally. Han et al. proposed ``human-in-the-loop'' idea to easily estimate the transition matrix~. Specifically, they proposed a human-assisted approach called ``Masking'' that conveys human cognition of invalid class transitions and naturally speculates the structure of the noise transition matrix. Then, they regarded the matrix structure as prior knowledge, which is further incorporated into deep probabilistic modeling.\nMoreover, Zhang et al. introduced an implicit regularization called mixup~, which constructs virtual training data by linear interpolations of features and labels in training data. Mixup encourages the model to behave linearly in-between training examples, which reduces the amount of undesirable oscillations when predicting outside the training examples. Zhang et al. generalized both categorical cross entropy loss and mean absoulte error loss by the negative Box-Cox transformation~. Their proposed $\\mathcal{L}_q$ loss not only has theoretical justification, but also work for both closed-set and open-set noisy labels. Motivated by a dimensionality perspective, Ma [2018] developed a dimensionality-driven learning strategy, which can effectively learn robust low-dimensional subspaces that capture the true data distribution.", "cites": [3340, 4139, 4130, 4183, 4145, 4455, 7773, 4128, 7191, 4136], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7692307692307693, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by organizing early works into themes like noise adaptation, bootstrapping, and regularization, and connecting them to broader principles.

Arazo et al. formulated clean and noisy samples as a two-component (clean-noisy) beta mixture model on the loss values~, where the posterior probabilities are then used to implement a dynamically weighted bootstrapping loss. To boost the performance of Co-teaching, Chen et al. introduced the Iterative Noisy Cross-Validation (INCV) method to select a subset of most confident samples (with correct labels)~, while Yu et al. employed the ``Update by Disagreement'' strategy to keep two networks diverged~. Hendrycks et al. empirically demonstrated that pre-training (i.e., ``pre-train then tune'' paradigm) can improve model robustness against label corruption~, which is for large-scale noisy datasets.\nUnder the criteria of balanced error rate (BER) minimization and area under curve (AUC) maximization, Charoenphakdee et al. found that symmetric losses have many merits in combating with noisy labels, even without knowing the noise information. Based on such observation, they proposed Barrier Hinge Loss~. In contrast to selected samples via small-loss tricks, Thulasidasan et al. introduced the abstention-based training, which allows deep abstaining networks to abstain on confusing samples while learning on non-confusing samples~. Following the re-weighting strategy, Shu et al. parameterized the weighting function adaptively as one-layer multilayer perceptron called Meta-Weight-Net~, which is free of manually pre-specifying the weighting function.\nEntering 2020, Menon et al. mitigated the effects of label noise from an optimization lens, namely using composite loss-based gradient clipping, which naturally introduces the partially Huberised loss for training deep models~. Nguyen et al. proposed a self-ensemble label filtering method to progressively filter out the wrong labels during training~. Li et al. modeled the per-sample loss distribution with a mixture model to dynamically divide the training data into a labeled set with clean samples and an unlabeled set with noisy samples~. Lyu et al. proposed a provable curriculum loss, which can adaptively select samples for robust stagewise training~. Han et al. proposed a versatile approach called scaled stochastic integrated gradient underweighted ascent (SIGUA)~. SIGUA uses gradient decent on good data, while using scaled stochastic gradient ascent on bad data rather than dropping those data. After Clothing1M born in 5 years, Jiang et al. proposed a new but realistic type of noisy dataset called ``web-label noise'' (or red noise)~, which enables us to conduct controlled experiments systematically in more realistic scenario.", "cites": [4456, 4140, 4126, 4135, 4253, 4182, 3342, 7133, 7781, 4457, 7774], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8461538461538461, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section demonstrates analytical insight by discussing how different LNRL methods address label noise, drawing connections between them, such as the use of mixture models or abstention strategies.

First, we can augment the objective via either explicit regularizer, e.g., \nMinimum Entropy Regularization~, or \nimplicit regularizer, e.g., \nVirtual Adversarial Training~. Second, instead of treating all sub-objective functions equally, we can leverage the reweighting strategy to assign different weights to sub-objective functions. The more weights we assign, the more importance these sub-objective functions have. We can realize the reweighting strategy via different ways, e.g., importance reweighting, a Bayesian method, a mixture model and neural networks. Lastly, we can modify the objective function via redesigning the loss function, e.g., $\\ell_q$, barrier hinge loss, partial Huberized loss and curriculum loss. Moreover, we can conduct the label ensemble, e.g., the temporal ensembling and self-ensemble filtering.\nNote that there are other related works from the objective perspective.
