With the development of communication technology and the ravage of COVID-19, different types of dialogues have emerged as an important way for information exchange. Therefore, there is an urgent need for summarization techniques to save people from large amounts of dialogue data.  \nConventional works mainly focus on single-participant document summarization, such as news and scientific papers .\nThanks to the neural models, especially the sophisticated pre-trained language models, which have advanced these tasks significantly .\nDespite the success of single-participant document summarization, these methods can not be easily transferred to the multi-participant dialogue summarization.\nFirstly, the dialogue contains multiple participants, inherent topic drifts, frequent coreferences, diverse interactive signals and domain terminologies . All of these characteristics make dialogue a hard-to-model data type.\nSecondly, in terms of different domains, the above characteristics further pose domain-specific challenges to summarization models, e.g., \\textit{How to model long meeting transcripts} .\nThirdly, compared with widely used document summarization benchmarks, collecting labeled dialogue-summary paired data is highly-costing or even intractable . \nTo mitigate these challenges, researchers draw on successful experiences from the study of dialogue systems and natural language generation techniques and put their efforts on solving this challenging task, which result in nearly 100 papers covering various domains being published over the past 5 years.\nTo review the current progress and help new researchers get into the field quickly, we present this first survey for dialogue summarization.\nAs the preliminary, we quickly overview the recent progress in general summarization and capture several key time points and key techniques, this serves as a strong background before we dive into the dialogue summarization (see \\S\\ref{sec:bg}).\nAs the core content, we summarize existing works according to the domain of dialogue, mainly covering the meeting, chat, email thread, customer service and medical dialogue. \nFor each type of dialogue, we thoroughly go through related research works, organize them according to their unique challenges and provide suggestions for future works (see \\S\\ref{sec:tax}). \nFor example, we focus on two main streams of works for chat summarization including interaction and participant modeling .\nIn terms of customer service, we organize related works from two perspectives, one is inherent topic modeling , the other is task-oriented-specific information integration .\nBesides, we provide an overview of publicly available research datasets (see Table \\ref{tab:datasets}). Especially for meeting and chat summarization, we also carefully organize leaderboards under the unified evaluation metric by collecting reported results from published literatures and re-evaluating official outputs (see Table \\ref{tab:ami_bench} and Table \\ref{tab:samsum_bench}).\nBased on the analyses of existing works, we present several research directions, including faithfulness in dialogue summarization, multi-modal, multi-domain and multi-lingual dialogue summarization (see \\S\\ref{sec:new}). All of these frontiers not only pose new research challenges but also meet actual application needs and fit in with real-world scenarios.\nTo sum up, our contributions are as follows: \n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We are the first to present a comprehensive survey for the dialogue summarization task.\n    \\item We thoroughly summarize existing works according to different types of dialogues and carefully organize leaderboards under the unified evaluation metric.\n    \\item We discuss some new frontiers and highlight their challenges to motivate future researches.\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [46, 42, 44, 45, 43, 7186], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from cited papers by highlighting domain-specific challenges and common issues in dialogue summarization, such as coreference and data collection.

Importantly, fine-grained dialogue-specific features need to be incorporated into the summarization model, such as personal pronoun information, coreference information and tense information. On the one hand, these features can implicitly alleviate the difficulty of dialogue understanding. On the other hand, some features can directly serve as the explicitly extracted information to help final summary generation.", "cites": [51], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 1, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of factuality errors in dialogue summarization, referencing a taxonomy from a single cited paper.

As shown in Table \\ref{tab:datasets}, diverse dialogue summarization datasets covering various domains have been proposed in recent years. \nFuture works can adopt meta-learning methods or rely on pre-trained language models to unify different datasets and mine common features.", "cites": [7189], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 1, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic synthesis of multi-domain dialogue summarization by categorizing it into macro and micro levels and relating it to general and domain-specific datasets.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for providing people with dialogue summaries in a preferred language. However, current works overwhelmingly focused on English, while leaving other languages under exploration. We argue that the current dilemma is mainly caused by the intractable access to available multi-lingual data resources.\nFirstly, future works should devote efforts to creating a suitable testbed for multi-lingual dialogue summarization. As an initial step, \\newcite{gupshup} transform English utterances in the SAMSum dataset into Hindi-English utterances and study the chat summarization under the code-switched setting. \nFrom a higher point of view, large-scale high-quality datasets covering diverse languages should be carefully crafted.\nPractically speaking, on the one hand, researchers can translate one specific dataset into different languages followed by automatic and human quality checking to get aligned datasets. On the other hand, researchers can also borrow ideas from unsupervised multi-lingual learning to utilize currently available datasets in different languages. Secondly, future works should set up systematic settings for this multi-lingual research, including \\textit{one-to-one}, \\textit{one-to-many}, \\textit{many-to-one} and \\textit{many-to-many}, in which \\textit{one-to-one} setting can be further divided into \\textit{mono-lingual} setting and \\textit{cross-lingual} setting . Thirdly, plenty of multi-lingual pre-trained language models can be explored for this task. Especially, models that have already been fine-tuned on the translation datasets may bring significant benefits", "cites": [52], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 1, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes the cited paper (Gupshup et al.) and extends its ideas to the context of dialogue summarization, establishing relevance to multi-lingual settings.
