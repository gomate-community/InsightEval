The basic component of these CPSs are the robots. A robot is an autonomous entity that can perceive the external environment, make intelligent decisions, and trigger physical actions. Although a robot is equipped with computing resources to conduct small-scale data processing, it cannot carry out large-scale computations on its own . To deal with this limitation of standalone robots, the concept of multi-robot system has been emerged. In multi-robot systems, a group of robots (connected via a wired or wireless network) work collaboratively to achieve a common goal . For example, in a smart factory, some robots handle the inventory while others check the safety and quality; and collectively they contribute to the production management. Nevertheless, the performance of multi-robot system is subject to the heterogeneous energy capacity of robots. In case of widespread deployment, the maintenance of persistent communication among the robots becomes difficult due to their mobility. The lack of storage within the robots causes further disruptions in exchanging and preserving the large volume of data during robot-to-robot interactions . To overcome these limitations, the concept of cloud computing has been extended to multi-robot system, which is termed as cloud robotics . In this paradigm, cloud offers the computing resources such as virtual machines or containers and engages resources from both local robots and remote data centres for scalable and extensive data processing .\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[height=3in,width=6in]{multi-agent_cloud_robotics_Architecture-eps-converted-to.pdf} \n\\caption{A multi-agent cloud robotic system and its benefits.}\n\\label{fig:multi-agent_cloudRobotics}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\par However, the robotic systems and the cloud data centres are normally multi-hop distance apart and that is responsible for longer communication time and data transfer delay. As a result, cloud robotics often becomes less suitable for latency-sensitive operations. Edge computing can play a vital role in addressing this limitation by bringing the infrastructure, platform, and software services closer to the data sources through cloudlet  and fog nodes . The integration of edge computing  with existing cloud robotics  paves the way of creating a new computing paradigm for executing robotic applications and their associated tasks on the physical resources at different communication hops from robot-to-cloud. Since this new paradigm simultaneously harnesses the computing capabilities at device level (robot), edge level (fog node, cloudlet) and remote level (cloud data centres), in this paper, it is termed as multi-agent cloud robotics. Figure \\ref{fig:multi-agent_cloudRobotics} depicts the organization and benefits of a multi-agent cloud robotic system. In this system, tasks with hard real-time constraints such as robotic surgery in smart hospital , soft real-time tasks with less restrictive deadline such as pesticide spraying in smart farm , and parcel distribution in smart factory  can be performed. The edge computing platform performs the soft real-time tasks including field image processing and path planning. On the other hand, the latency-tolerant and high storage requiring tasks such as eHealth report distribution and weather forecasting are managed by the cloud data centre.\nIn the context of CPSs, multi-agent cloud robotics can bring various benefits as listed below.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{By exploiting computing resources at different infrastructure levels, it provides options to the CPSs for executing diverse robotic applications.}\n\\item{It offers an abstraction to classify the tasks of robotic applications as per the characteristics of computing infrastructures.}\n\\item{It provides distributed resources to process big data generated in the CPSs with reduced communication delay.}\n\\item{It enhances the competency of robots in sharing knowledge using local and edge network rather than depending on the distant cloud.}\n\\item{It significantly reduces the bandwidth requirements (for sending data to cloud) in CPSs dealing with multiple devices, by bringing the resources closer to the robots.}\n\\item{With multi-agent cloud robotics, the dependency of the CPSs to the cloud data centre as well as the load on cloud data centre (to handle multiple CPSs) is sharply decreased.}  \n\\end{itemize} \n\\par Based on the characteristics, a multi-agent cloud robotic system appears similar to the contemporary computing paradigms, namely, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)  and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) , where the edge computation is extensively harnessed. However, there exist explicit differences among the functionalities of these paradigms. They are discussed as follows.", "cites": [3354, 3353], "cite_extract_rate": 0.125, "origin_cites_number": 16, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section introduces the concept of multi-agent cloud robotics and outlines its benefits, incorporating ideas from the cited papers on fog computing and edge computing.

Through an intermediate layer of cloudlets between the smart phones and cloud data centres, MCC manages a 3-tier execution platform for the offloaded applications. MCC supports both local and global distribution of computing and application services through private resources. These services are accessed using LAN or WiFi technology . On the other hand, MEC manages a virtual server on the cellular base stations to assist faster networking, location tracking and content delivery services for the smart phone and Internet of Things (IoT) users . It usually offers a multi-tier computing platform for the applications, where the services are reachable via one-hop proximal distant access points using LTE, 3GPP or 5G network technology . Generally, the MEC infrastructures are provided by telecom operators. Unlike MCC and MEC, a multi-agent cloud robotic system follows an $n$-tier resource orientation, where the services are offered by harnessing local (robots), proximal (edge resources), or global (cloud data centres) computing agents. Here, the primary data producers are the sensor clusters, IoT devices and robots and the services are accessed by wireless access technologies including WiFi, LTE, Zigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa technology including 3GPP and 5G .\\par Moreover, compared to MCC and MEC, multi-agent cloud robotics explicitly supports artificial intelligence so that robots can make autonomous decision. Being an intelligent entity, robots are able to learn from the environment and alter their predefined mobility pattern dynamically. Conversely, MCC and MEC do not support autonomous mobility as the end devices generally operate through human intervention. These distinctive architectural and operational features make a multi-agent cloud robotic system more complicated than MCC and MEC.\n\\par Since the multi-agent cloud robotics is a complex synthesis of robotics, tele-operation, edge computing and core cloud technologies, the performance of such an environment depends on proper management and co-ordination among heterogeneous resources. Therefore, efficient resource allocation and service provisioning policies are required to fully exploit the benefits of multi-agent cloud robotics. Generally speaking, resource allocation refers to the assignment of requested applications to the competent resources, whereas service provisioning sets the base for resource allocation through resource pooling and computation offloading, and assists in task scheduling. The development of efficient resource allocation and service provisioning policies often becomes challenging due to the diverse requirements unique to multi-agent cloud robotics.\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering \n\\caption{Comparison with related computing paradigms of multi-agent cloud robotics}\\label{Tab:summary_rel_concept} \n\\scriptsize\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{3.6cm}|p{3.7cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{4.9cm}|}\\hline \n\\textbf{Dimension} & \\textbf{Mobile Cloud Computing} & \\textbf{Multi-Access Edge Computing} & \\textbf{Multi-Agent Cloud Robotics} \\\\\\hline \nGeo-distribution& Local/ Global&\tLocal/ Proximal&\tLocal/ Proximal/ Global\\\\\\hline\nResource orientation& 3-tier& 2/3-tier & $n$-tier \\\\\\hline \nInfrastructure provider& Private entities & Telecom operators& Private entities/ Cloud provider\\\\\\hline\nApplication type& Lightweight & Lightweight & Lightweight/ Heavyweight \\\\\\hline\nData producer & Mobile devices & IoT devices/ Cellular gateways& Multiple sensors/ IoT devices/ Robots \\\\\\hline\nGeneral data type &\tBatch &\tSimple stream &\tComplex stream \\\\\\hline\nService access & LAN/ WiFi & LTE/ 3GPP/ 5G &\tWiFi/ LTE/ Zigbee/ Bluetooth/ LoRa/ 3GPP/ 5G \\\\\\hline\nAutonomous learning support&No&\tNo&\tYes\\\\\\hline\nAutonomous mobility&No&\tNo&\tYes\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}  \n\\end{table*}", "cites": [3355], "cite_extract_rate": 0.125, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "comparative", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a clear comparison between multi-agent cloud robotics and related paradigms such as MCC and MEC, integrating a synthesis of features from the cited paper on MEC and general knowledge.

Although edge infrastructure in multi-agent cloud robotics helps meeting real-time service requirements, it lacks support for installing numerous resource-enriched computing devices with large amount of processing cores and GPUs due to cost, structural and maintenance constraints. Consequently, they limit the scope of executing compute-intensive artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Therefore, the resource allocation and service provisioning in multi-agent cloud robotics urges rigorous classification and selection of compatible resources for robotic applications which is not mandatory for MCC and MEC dealing with predefined set of events and actions.}\n\\item{\\textit{Complex data stream processing:} Multi-agent cloud robotics requires modular robotic applications with diverse programming models including map-reduce and distributed data flow to process complex data streams generated by robot-embedded multi-purpose sensors . Due to resource and communication constraints, the local and proximal resources of multi-agent cloud robotics often fail to participate in such intense data processing that increases the burden on global resources. Therefore, resource allocation and service provisioning policies for a multi-agent cloud robotics system need to determine where to process data streams in real time. This significantly differs from MCC and MEC, which generally process simple batch or stream data generated by conventional sensors of smart phones and IoT devices.}\n\\item{\\textit{Dynamic robotic cooperation:} There are some cases such as earthquake disaster management and submarine cable maintenance when multiple heterogeneous robots need to work collaboratively for attaining a common goal. Moreover, while operating in such adverse working environments with limited communication support, the real-time robot-to-robot and robot-to-edge or cloud interactions get hampered significantly . To meet these requirements and constraints, the robotic cooperation often depends on distributed but coordinated algorithms such as federated learning and distributed learning, which adds further resource management overhead to multi-agent cloud robotics. The resource and service provisioning policies should address this issue deliberately that is not compulsory in MCC and MEC due to their simplified working environments.}\n\\item{\\textit{Cross-infrastructure interoperability:} In multi-agent cloud robotics, heterogeneous and distributed computing resources complement the robots to carry out their responsibilities. These resources are owned by different service providers. For example, multi-agent cloud robotic systems can use the Google or Amazon cloud infrastructure and their edge infrastructure can be set by the cellular service providers. The resource sharing, privacy, and fault tolerance functions of these infrastructure are also managed with separate black box software systems. Therefore, the resource allocation and service provisioning policies in multi-agent cloud robotics require support for cross-infrastructure and policy-driven interoperability, which is not essential for MCC and MEC because of their association with homogeneous resource providers.}\n\\item{\\textit{Synchronized decision making:} Since multi-agent cloud robotics involves computing infrastructure from different communication layers to execute robotic applications, an explicit synchronization of decision making entities belonging to these infrastructure is highly required. However, the attainment of such synchronization becomes challenging due to the intelligence interference among robots, edge, and cloud resources. Therefore, resource allocation and service provisioning policies should fairly distribute the resource management responsibilities among multiple decision making entities, which is not obligatory for MCC and MEC relying on a single decision maker.}\n\\item{\\textit{On-demand computation and communication trade-off:} The offloading facility in multi-agent cloud robotics enables the robots having low energy or low processing power to access the edge and cloud infrastructure and execute the compute-intensive robotic applications. To conduct this activity, a seamless interaction among local robots, edge and remote resources are required which consumes additional communication time. It becomes more complicated because of the uncertain mobility of robots. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of resources in multi-agent cloud robotics with respect to processing cores, networking standards and energy consumption rates intensifies the appropriate resource selection problem for offloading. Therefore, resource allocation and service provisioning policies in multi-agent cloud robotics require on-demand computation and communication trade-off . On the other hand, in MCC and MEC, the computation and communication trade-off often depend on predefined rules because of the static mobility pattern of the users.}\n\\item{\\textit{System-specific policy:} In multi-agent cloud robotics, the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of robotic systems vary from one to another. For example, the service delivery deadline for a robotic application in smart hospital is more stringent than that of in smart farm. Similarly, for some robotic systems, higher accuracy is important such as robotic surgery, whereas for others the minimization of cost is vital such as smart factory maintenance. A generalized resource allocation and service provisioning policy is not feasible for multi-agent cloud robotics like MCC and MEC. Therefore, system-specific policies are required for efficient resource management, which is quite difficult due to the dynamics of robotic systems.}\n\\item{\\textit{Energy-delay optimization:} Although computing resources from every layer of the hierarchical architecture participate in executing robotic applications, still the realization of such an environment is constrained by the energy limitations of the resources. Moreover, it is challenging to finish the application execution with the residual energy of the resources. Specifically, in a multi-agent cloud robotic system, robots can perform simultaneously as a service provider and a user. As a result, the energy limitations of robots significantly hamper the execution of applications compared to MCC and MEC. Therefore, selection of appropriate resources and time-efficient resource allocation are required to deliver services within the energy constraints of the resources.}\n\\item{\\textit{Comprehensive business model:} Cloud computing has a widely accepted business model for subscription-oriented services. However, such business model is not feasible for edge infrastructure as it mainly deals with event-driven and localized demand. On the other hand, robotic systems often require a set of reserved resources for processing their complex stream of data. Due to such variations of service requirements, it is complicated to develop a comprehensive business model for multi-agent cloud robotics that significantly disrupts the cost and budget-satisfying resource allocation, which is generally easier to develop in MCC and MEC.}\n\\item{\\textit{Security and safety:} In a multi-agent cloud robotics system, robots are able to share the resources with other robots, edge resources as well as cloud data centre. Consequently, this system can easily become a target for security threats at every communication layer (local, edge, and cloud). The number of points of data exposure is comparatively higher in multi-agent cloud robotics than in MCC and MEC. Even in a local network, if any robot becomes vulnerable to privacy and security threats, it can easily manipulate others' data in the system because of robot itself being an intelligent entity. This type of risk is relatively lower in MCC and MEC. In addition, due to the random mobility of the robots, they are required to communicate over heterogeneous networks that gives rise to another security issue. Therefore, for efficient resource allocation and service provisioning, the selection of reliable resources is crucial. Apart from the security vulnerabilities, uncertain events such as link failures, edge node shout down, power cut and interference can obstruct the robots to access the infrastructure services. In such cases, proactive and reactive fault tolerance techniques are helpful to make the system robust; however, it is difficult to develop these techniques due to the dynamics of multi-agent cloud robotic systems.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\\par Resource allocation and service provisioning have been well studied in different computing paradigms including MCC and MEC .

Cloud instances, local robots and edge nodes are the basic computational resources.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{{\\em Cloud instances}:} Cloud instances are allocated to robotic applications for large-scale computation. Cloud service providers virtualize the computing servers and offer a variety of computing instances including virtual machines (VMs) and containers to the multi-agent robotic systems. The authors of  focus on allocating cloud instances for executing robotic applications. Moreover, cloud instances are dynamically configurable according to the resource requirements of the applications. However, the integration of robotic systems with the cloud instances depends on the category of cloud infrastructure namely public, private, edge and hybrid cloud.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{{\\em Public cloud}:} In this of cloud infrastructure, the instances are accessed on-demand over the Internet . It bestows the greatest level of efficiency in shared resources where the cloud users must pay as per the usage. In the literature, \ndeploy public cloud infrastructure for the robotic applications. However, the resources in public cloud often become vulnerable to security issues. Due to geographical distance, the data transfer also gets delayed while executing robotic tasks using public cloud.\n\\item{{\\em Private cloud}:} In this type of cloud infrastructure, instances are accessed through a private network. It supports versatile and convenient end-to-end interaction, where the management of the resources are conducted within the local data centres.  adopt private cloud for their systems. Private cloud provides more security than public cloud. However, the maintenance of private cloud requires dedicated administrator, which is not always cost efficient for the multi-robot systems. \n\\item{{\\em Hybrid cloud}:} It is a combination of public and private cloud infrastructure with an additional orchestration and automation support . In this type of cloud infrastructure, the tasks of real-time or mission-critical applications are run on the private cloud instances while the public cloud instances deal with the delay tolerant tasks . Hybrid cloud for multi-agent cloud robotics is considered in . Hybrid cloud can also encapsulate edge resources as mentioned in . Nevertheless, the goal of hybrid cloud is to ensure a scalable environment for networked robots where the instances can be extended either from public or private cloud infrastructure based on the task requirements. However, such management of instances in hybrid cloud becomes a challenging issue when there exist an explicit data-dependency among the robotic tasks.\n\\end{itemize}  \n\\par As there exist pros and cons of each type of cloud infrastructure, the resource allocation policies for multi-agent cloud robotics require to observe them deliberately while dealing with the robotic applications.\n\\item{{\\em Local robots}:} The on-board CPU within the robots also supports the task execution of robotic applications. In multi-agent cloud robotic systems, local resources can be shared among the connected robots to complete the task execution in a collaborate manner. For example, the local robots are used for robotic task execution in . However, the on-board computing components often become exhausted because of the size, shape, power supply, motion mode and working environments of the robots . Resource re-configuration is also infeasible once the robots are built for a particular system. Despite of such constraints, it is still conducive to use the local robotic resources for the hard real-time robotic applications since they offer comparatively lesser data transfer delay.   \n\\item{{\\em Edge infrastructure}:} The inter-communication delay in sending the computation request to cloud and receiving the response at the local robots resist the whole system in meeting the QoS requirements of robotic applications. Local robots have limited energy and computational capacity, which further hamper the execution of large-scale real-time applications. To address these limitations, the concept of edge computing is introduced between the robots and the cloud in multi-agent cloud robotics. Edge infrastructures such as cloudlet or edge cloud and fog nodes facilitate task execution in proximity of the robotic systems and consequently enhances the QoS of the applications.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{{\\em Cloudlet or edge cloud}:} Basically Cloudlet or edge cloud is an extension of cloud that can provide virtualized resources and assist multi-robot systems in executing the latency sensitive and compute-intensive tasks . Integrating both edge and cloud computing with the robotics, a platform is introduced in . Moreover, the local robots and edge cloud are allocated for reducing communication delay in .\n\\item{{\\em Fog node}:} Any personal computer, mobile device, smart edge device, car, sensors, traditional networking devices including set-top boxes, gateway routers, smart switches, proxy servers equipped with computational resources are generally used as potential fog nodes and they are deployed in a distributed manner across the edge . Rather than forwarding the tasks of latency sensitive robotic applications to a centralized cloudlet or private cloud, they can be processed more efficiently at the edge network using fog nodes .

In literature, there exist several techniques for wireless power transmission including radiative power transfer (microwave, laser) and non-radiative power transfer technologies are (inductive, magnetic resonance, capacitive and acoustic) .

Virtualization techniques and NoSQL databases play the vital roles in storing the information in cloud storages. These information are explicitly maintained, operated, and managed by the cloud service providers. Additionally, cloud storages support collective learning by providing application programming interfaces for analysing historical behaviours according to task requirements . However, in multi-agent cloud robotic system while executing robotic applications, the exchange of information should be happening in real-time. In this case, an uninterrupted Internet connectivity is a must. Moreover, there are some sensitive applications where the data privacy is regarded as one of the QoS requirements. To deal with such applications, the selection of appropriate cloud infrastructures is very important.\n\\item{{\\em Robotic storage}:} The built-in memory of the local robots can collectively support the additional storage resources for multi-agent cloud robotics. A group of connected robots usually share information among each other while executing the robotic applications in a collaborative manner. Robotic storage allows the robots to store necessary information locally so that the robots residing outside the communication range, can still participate in learning and data collection.

In multi-agent cloud robotics, service provider is responsible to allocate resources according to the requirements of an application and avoid the SLA violations. The performance of a system in terms of SLA depends on ratio of the number of successfully executed tasks and the number of total assigned tasks . In , QoS is enhanced by minimizing the SLA violations.\n\\item{{\\em Availability}:} The accessibility, usability, scalability of the resources while executing the applications defines the availability of resources in multi-agent cloud robotics. The service providers must ensure resource availability prior to allocating them to any robotic application. However, in , SLA and resource availability are simultaneously counted as the QoS parameters.\n\\item{{\\em Fault tolerance}:} This property enables a computing paradigm to continue the execution of assigned tasks even after the failure of any computing and networking entities . In multi-agent cloud robotics, uncertain anomalies such as link failures, power shortage, limited bandwidth and interference can hamper the simultaneous execution of the robotic application.

For realizing resource pooling, a service provider at first needs to locate and retrieve the existing resources across multiple infrastructure domains in multi-agent cloud robotics, which is commonly known as resource discovery. After discovering, resource scaling through aggregation, amalgamation and shifting is required to make the pool of resources compatible for hosting robotic applications. However, for creating any resource pool, two major research questions are required to be addressed. They are discussed below.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{\\textit{How secured the resources are?:} While selecting resources from local, edge and cloud infrastructure to create resource pool, the security of the resources needs to be ensured. The security issues can be classified with multiple aspects. Firstly, it is essential to protect the physical resources from malicious attacks. While sharing data with other robots, edge resources and cloud data centre, unauthorized access to data needs to be prevented by strong integrity and confidentiality protection . It is necessary to ensure that the robots only interact with legitimate servers and reliable devices. Reversely, with the help of authentication scheme edge or cloud data centre will only establish communication link with authorized robots and reject illegal communication requests. Privacy preservation is another fundamental requirement for data transmission among robots, robot-to-edge/cloud, and edge-to-cloud. Robust encryption mechanism is a viable solution to maintain data privacy. In multi-agent cloud robotics, for service provisioning, wireless access services from heterogeneous networks from multiple service providers may be required. Consequently, communication and transmission process become riskier for their inherent security vulnerabilities. Therefore, while creating the resource pool, trust-worthy resource selection is mandatory for efficient service provisioning. In addition, efficient security measures are required to prevent vulnerabilities both at resource level and communication level. Different mechanisms such as trust establishment, reputation-based trust, trust measurement techniques  have been well studied in literature to provide trust-worthy resources. Recently, blockchain technology has become popular to address the security and privacy concerns in multi-agent cloud robotics .} \n\\item{\\textit{How efficiently resources can interact?:} While creating the resource pool  in multi-agent cloud robotics, the selection of communication networks and protocols play an important role for efficient data exchange among resources and to maintain the QoS of the applications. Existing networking protocols have been widely used for wired or wireless communications in multi-agent cloud robotic systems . Nevertheless, the efficiency of such communication depends on the working environment and application scenario. Consequently, depending on the contexts, researchers have adopted miscellaneous communication protocols to reduce data transmission delay and offer better QoS. Robots can communicate among themselves and with cloud using middleware like ROS.\nHowever, this type of middleware cannot always support secured communication. Another key challenge for communication in a dynamic environment is to optimize route discovery and route maintenance with minimum computation time and resource requirement. Gossip protocol is recommended in  for robot-to-robot and robot-to-cloud communications that are particularly suited for mobile robots. Data stream network (DSN) and controller area network (CAN) are adopted for real-time communication in  and , respectively. Micro Internet protocol (uIP) is adopted in  to support simplified communication between robot and cloud for data transmission. TCP or IP socket based communication also benefits robots for faster communicate with cloud . However, for delay-sensitive applications, it is always time consuming to send data to cloud rather than communicating with edge resources. Using short-range wireless communications technologies such as Zigbee, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi direct, robots get services from the edge resources . A heartbeat protocol is implemented in  to deal with network latency of multi-agent cloud robotics. Network bandwidth usage can be substantially preserved by processing the data on edge resources . Packet delivery failure and communication outage are inherent drawbacks of wireless communications . Therefore, backup mechanisms are required, and the system needs to be robust enough to recover from unwanted events.}\n\\end{itemize}", "cites": [8647, 3365, 3366, 3361], "cite_extract_rate": 0.19047619047619047, "origin_cites_number": 21, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of resource pooling in multi-agent cloud robotics, integrating key concepts from cited papers such as blockchain for security and specific communication protocols like ROS and uIP.

It is the responsibility of robots to conduct either full or partial offloading based on the assessment of network profile (bandwidth, access point), device profile (battery status, local storage), and system objectives (minimize cost, distance, time, energy).\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{{\\em Partial offloading}:} In this offloading approach, rather than forwarding the whole application, a part of the application is transferred from local robot to remote instances for execution. The remaining parts are either managed by local robots or sent to other computing infrastructure like edge.  \n\\item{{\\em Full offloading}:} This is a conventional approach for offloading in multi-agent cloud robotics, where the application is transferred completely to the remote cloud for execution and after execution the results are sent back to local robots. It increases the burden on communication link by sending a large volume of data along with the application to the remote destination.     \n\\end{itemize} \n\\par Partial offloading supports parallel processing and consequently allows load distribution among the resources. The waiting time to process the data on a single resource is also reduced. However, data dependency among the resources becomes higher as tasks are partitioned among multiple resources. It consumes additional time for task partition and result aggregation from different resources. On the contrary, in full offloading, since the entire computation is offloaded, the burden of task partitioning diminishes and the decision making becomes easier. Nevertheless, it incurs higher bandwidth to send the full task and consumes higher energy of single resource. Therefore, a trade-off exists between computation and communication in offloading decision making. In addition, energy-delay optimization is also required for making efficient offloading decision.\n\\par Another crucial criterion of offloading is to distribute the offloaded tasks among the robots. It basically depends on the available local resources (robots) and their orientation. Regarding this feature, the offloading decision-making factors are classified as follows: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{{\\em Single robot}:} For a single robot, the offloading decision depends on the location and the appropriate offloading approach that ensures optimal transfer of information between robot and the computing instances.\n\\item{{\\em Multiple robot}:} In this approach, multiple robots work collaboratively to complete the offloading operation. It requires to make a balance between robot-to-robot coordination and robot-to-cloud or edge communication.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{table*}[!htb]\n\\centering \n\\caption{A Summary of works concentrating on computation offloading in multi-agent cloud robotics}\\label{Tab:summary_of_offloading} \n\\scriptsize\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{0.7 cm}|p{1cm}|p{.9cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{1.8cm}|p{4cm}|p{2.4cm}|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Work} &  \\textbf{Offloading Type}& \\textbf{Decision Maker} & \\textbf{Methodology} & \\textbf{Objective} &  \\textbf{Evaluation Method} &  \\textbf{Results}&  \\textbf{Use Case} \\\\\\hline  \n&Partial&Single & Multi-level decision using heuristic & Minimize time and energy& Testbed& Saves 0.052s and 19.63J than local execution. &Object recognition and motion control.\\\\\\hline\n&Full& Multiple& Greedy approach & Minimize path cost&Testbed&Find the shortest path faster than local robot.&Path planning.\\\\\\hline \n&Partial&Multiple& Cloud based task execution  & Minimize network latency&Prototype& Only 1\\% false positive result.&Object recognition and grasping. \\\\\\hline\n&Partial& Multiple&  Path planning using heuristic & Minimize time&Simulation&Offers 90\\% better result.&Path planning in smart home and healthcare. \\\\\\hline\n&Full& Single&  Dynamic parallel algorithm &\tMinimize communication cost&Prototype&Performs better than only robotic execution.& Vision based navigation assistant. \\\\\\hline\n &Partial/Full& Single & Genetic algorithm & Balance energy and network lifetime&Theoretical analysis and simulation & Lifetime of the network is prolonged&Generalized robotic applications. \\\\\\hline\n&Full&Multiple & Context-aware greedy approach & Minimize energy and cost&Simulation.&Context awareness performs better in material handling &Smart factory. \\\\\\hline \n&Full&Multiple& Market-based management strategy &Minimize time&Testbed, Simulation&Significant improvement in bandwidth usage and load balancing.& Generalized real-time robotic tasks. \\\\\\hline \n&Partial&Multiple&QoS-aware game theory &Minimize latency and energy&Simulation&Stable performance gain with increasing number of robots.& Generalized robotic applications. \\\\\\hline\n&Partial/Full&Single&Genetic algorithm & Minimize energy, time and distance&Simulation&Communication and mobility-aware offloading provide better performance.&Smart factory. \\\\\\hline   \n&Full&Multiple&Genetic algorithm & Minimize overall system energy&Simulation&Reduce energy consumption.&Smart factory. \\\\\\hline\n&Full&Multiple&Deep RL based offloading &\tMinimize communication cost&Simulation&Supports offloading for mobile robots.&Generalized robotic applications. \\\\\\hline\n&Partial&Multiple&Hierarchical iterative approach& Minimize energy, computation time&Theoretical analysis and simulation&Effectively reduce the energy consumption.&SLAM. \\\\\\hline \n\\end{tabular}  \n\\end{table*} \n\\par Using a single robot, the offloading decision becomes simple and requires less communication overhead. However, for a single robot, it is not always possible to get the complete overview of the system and make efficient decision to maintain the QoS. In addition, the failure of a single robot can affect the full system. On the other side, offloading decision with multiple robots offers prolonged network lifetime and better energy optimization. Yet, the synchronization of the decisions from multiple robots becomes challenging and the system becomes vulnerable to security issues due to higher exposure of data. Therefore, optimal selection of robots is essential in making offloading decision.\n\\par To sum up, the main challenge in computation offloading is to trade-off between the local and the remote computation and communication cost in multi-agent cloud robotics. It is also challenging to efficiently offload a task and receive the response, since the robots can move on-demand to multiple locations during the application execution period. Since the offloading performance depends on the network resources, it is required for the robots to make a balance between mobility and bandwidth utilization. Finally, the identification of an appropriate approach to perform the offloading based on the arbitrary system context requires further research. The pros and cons of different offloading schemes are summarized in Table \\ref{Tab:summary_of_offloading_techniques}.\n\\par In the context of multi-agent cloud robotics, computation offloading is considered as a trending topic. Therefore, over the last few years, plenteous research has been conducted in this area. Initial studies such as  give particular attention to the infrastructure and framework for offloading in multi-agent cloud robotics. Platforms to support offloading the compute-intensive tasks from the robotic network to cloud and edge resources are also furnished in . Subsequently, other studies including  exploit the optimal approach for efficient task offloading between local robot and remote computing instances. Additionally, task partitioning has been studied and established in , where the applications are decomposed in tasks and distributed among the robots and cloud resources. Furthermore, based on each decision-making criterion, the offloading performance can vary significantly. To deal with such cases, different offloading approaches according to the resource architecture, application profile and performance parameters are also accentuated in the literature. Table \\ref{Tab:summary_of_offloading} presents the summary of some notable works in computation offloading for multi-agent cloud robotics that refer the aforementioned attributes in detail. As seen in Table \\ref{Tab:summary_of_offloading}, most of the existing approaches perform full application offloading to cloud, whereas very few including  apply partial offloading. Another variation is seen in the number of engaged robots for offloading operations. For example, in , the authors consider single robot methods.  \n\\par In addition, most of the offloading algorithms follow heuristic approach () and evolutionary method (), whereas others adapt greedy algorithms (), game theory () and dynamic programming () to make offloading decisions. There also exist differences among the existing works in selecting the offloading objectives. Minimization of energy (), latency (), distance or movement cost () and  bandwidth or communication cost () are considered as the potential offloading objectives.\n\\par With the help of offloading, the management of resources become distributed among the local robots, edge and cloud. Based on the features of offloaded tasks, resources are usually allocated from the available resource pool. If the tasks to be offloaded are selected appropriately by the robots, task scheduling and service provisioning can be conducted efficiently at the edge or cloud. Nevertheless, if the resource of each cloud or edge server is limited, then offloading becomes inefficient. It turns into worst when all robots select the same server as the destination. Hence, a detailed study is required so that the offloading techniques in multi-agent cloud robotics can deal with such cases deliberately and improve the application QoS.", "cites": [8648, 3367, 7710], "cite_extract_rate": 0.12, "origin_cites_number": 25, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.8}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes information from multiple cited papers by categorizing offloading approaches (partial vs. full) and analyzing their trade-offs in terms of computation, communication, and energy.

For example, in robotic medical assistance, the electronic health report contains a significant amount of private information. Sometimes this information requires to be accessed by different professional and organization bodies including insurance, pharmacist, and doctors.
