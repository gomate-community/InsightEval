However, due to unexpected accidents, for example broken sensors or missing of the signals, \n  missing values are everywhere in time series. In some datasets, the missing rate can reach 90\\%, which makes the data hard to be utilized . \n  The missing values significantly do harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration \n  and forecasting tasks , leading to high demand for data imputation. \n  Our preliminary study  shows that imputing the missing values indeed helps significantly the prediction of fuel consumption.\n  In the scenarios of fuel consumption prediction, missing values happen due to the errors of sensors. \n  We propose an imputation approach named FuelNet to deal with such errors. The FuelNet generates proper values to impute missing data. With imputed data, the \n  fuel consumption can be reduced by around 45.5\\%.\n  In current stages, time series data imputation is a well studied problem with different categories of methods including \n  deletion methods, simple imputation methods and learning based methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, thus losing \n  the information from the time data.\n  Fortunately, with the increasing development of deep learning, a large quantity of deep learning methods are researched, among which RNN is one of the typical methods to handle sequence data. \n  The intuition on why deep learning models could advance imputation tasks is that, they are proven to have the ability to mine information hidden in the time series. These characteristics could enable them \n  to impute missing values with such models. \n  Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to multivariable time series imputation and show positive progress in imputing \n  the missing values. In this paper, we mainly survey three papers about time series imputation with deep learning methods \n  among which RNN, GRU and GAN are adopted separately or in combination. We will review these papers about their model structure, the common parts they all adopted and the advantages and disadvantages through comparison.\n  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we categorize existing data imputation methods and mainly give an introduction to deep learning imputation methods.\n  Section 3 will show the definition of the problems and the symbols. Section 4 will give a detailed discussion of deep learning methods, mainly about their concrete structure, advantages and disadvantages. \n  And finally in Section 5 we summarize the survey and give our conclusions.\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Comparison of different methods addressing time series imputation}\n  \\label{tab:comparison-of-methods}\n

Moreover, we will classify existing time series imputation methods according to the \nprinciples and techniques they rely on. \nIn order to impute the missing values, researchers have proposed many imputation methods to handle the missing values in time series. In this paper,\nwe mainly conclude 8 kinds of the missing value imputation methods including \\textbf{deletion methods}, \\textbf{neighbor based methods}, \\textbf{constraint based methods},\n\\textbf{regression based methods}, \\textbf{statistical based methods}, \\textbf{MF based methods}, \\textbf{EM based mathods}, \\textbf{MLP based mathods} and \\textbf{DL based methods}.\nTable~\\ref{tab:comparison-of-methods} shows the comparison of these methods we conclude. We will introduce each kind of method respectively as follows.\n\\textbf{Deletion methods} take a simple strategy that they directly erase the observations that contain missing values from the raw data . \nIt is also a commonly adopted strategy when the missing value is not \nhigh and the deletion of the missing values will not influence the downstream applications. However, when the missing rate reaches some level (in , it is 5\\%), \nignoring the missing values and deleting them make the data incomplete and not suitable for downstream applications. \n\\textbf{Neighbor based methods}  find out the imputation value from neighbors, e.g., identified by clustering methods like KNN or DBSCAN.\nThey first find the nearest neighbors of the missing values through other attributes, and then update the missing values with the mean value of these neighbors. \nMoreover, considering the local similarity, some methods take the last observed valid value to replace \nthe blank . \nSRKN (Swapping Repair with K Neighbors)  in our preliminary study could also be adapted to impute the missing values that are misplaced in other dimensions. \n\\textbf{Constraint based methods}  discover the rules in dataset, and take advantage of these rules to impute. \nTo apply to time series data, similarity rules such as differential dependencies  or comparable dependencies  could be employed that study the distances or similarities of timestamps as well as values . \nMore advanced constraints could be specified in a graph structure , such as Petri net, and employed to impute the qualitative values of events in time series .\nThese methods are effective when the data is highly continuous or satisfies certain patterns. For example, when the data is increasing linearly, it is effective and efficient\nto take simple methods or clustering methods. And when the rules or constraints are satisfied, constraints based methods outperform others in both time and accuracy .\nHowever, multivariable time series in the real world are not usually satisfied with such rules, thus more general methods are required and learning based methods are \nresearched to impute the time series automatically.\n\\textbf{Regression based methods} \nLOESS~ learns a regression model from nearest neighbors for predicting the missing value referring to the complete attributes.\nFor time series data, autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., ARX  and ARIMA ) try to predict missing values from historical data.\nMore advanced IMR (iterative minimum repairing ) provides both anomaly detection and data repair for both anomalies and missing values.\nThese methods mostly benefit from historical data as well as the accuracy of the nearest neighbors. Thus they could be applied when neighbors are reliable and the time series are highly relative.\n\\textbf{Statistical based methods} rely on statistical models to impute the missing values . \nSimple statistical methods just utilize the data in the original data to impute the missing values, such as take the mean value or median value of the \nattribute to impute . \n estimates probability values by statistics on speeds as well as the changes. \nRecently, more advanced IIM (Imputation via Individual models)  adaptively learns individual models for various number of neighbors.\nUnlike regression based methods which based on just historical data, statistical based models are learned from the whole dataset, including historical data and future data. \nTherefore, they may capture more information from raw data. \n\\textbf{Matrix Factorization based methods}\nThe Matrix Factorization (MF) algorithm tries to impute the value with the Matrix Factorization and reconstruction to find the correlations among the data and complete the missing values which is a classical method of \ncollaborative filtering . In recent years MF based approaches are introduced into time series imputation fields . \nIn general, MF based approaches decompose the data matrix into 2 low-dimensional matrices in the meantime extracting the features from original data. And then they try to reconstruct the original matrix and \nin this processing, missing values are imputed. \n\\textbf{Expectation-Maximization based methods}\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) based methods have been successfully applied to missing data imputation problems . EM based methods follow a two-stage strategy consisting of the E (Expectation) step and the \nM (Maximization) step which iteratively imputes the missing values with the statistical model parameters\nand then updates the statistical model parameters to maximize the possibility of the distribution of the filled data.\n\\textbf{Multi-Layer Perceptron based methods}\nMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based methods employee MLP, which is also called fully connected networks. MLP tries to predict missing value by complete values. It can be divided into 3 parts: input layers, hidden layers and output layers.\nIn this approach, by minimizing the loss function, the perceptron learns a function to impute missing values by input variables. In , MLP is used to predict missing values in neural network-based diagnostic systems.\nAnd in , MLP is employed to impute Population Census.\nRecently, \\textbf{deep learning based methods}  \nmainly deploy Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), since RNN is capable of capturing the time information. In these papers, time information is handled separately and \nattached with more importance. To impute the time series, not only RNN is used, they also combine the models like Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n \nto extract the long-term information, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  to generate the imputed values \nand Bidirectional Recurrent Networks to improve the accuracy . \nAccording to the above classification, due to the length, the methods for time series imputation are too many to give a detailed introduction. \nSince among these methods, deep learning based ones are the latest and most powerful, we will discuss 3 latest deep learning methods \nfor time series imputation, find the connections and the differences among them.", "cites": [8109, 6177], "cite_extract_rate": 0.05263157894736842, "origin_cites_number": 38, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of various time series imputation methods, including a classification into eight categories. While it references some papers and methods, it does so in a fragmented way without connecting the ideas cohesively. Limited critical evaluation is present, such as noting limitations of deletion methods at higher missing rates, but deeper analysis of strengths and weaknesses is missing. The section begins to generalize by grouping methods into categories, but the insights remain at a surface level without meta-level abstraction or synthesis across multiple sources."}}

All of them are deep learning approaches published recently for time series imputation tasks.\nAmong these methods, recurrent neural network (RNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) are main architectures that are adopted. \nThe reason is that RNN and its variations (e.g., LSTM, GRU) have been proven powerful in modeling sequence data, while GAN has been successfully applied to generation and imputation tasks.\nTo describe the relationships among these methods, we illustrate the dependencies and common structures of them in Figure~\\ref{fig:relationships}.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:relationships}, we use arrows to describe the dependencies, for example GRUI-GAN improves the work by using GAN while \nE$^2$GAN is the updated version of GRUI-GAN. And we use boxes to describe the common structures among the methods, for example GRU-D and BRITS are both pure RNN models and \nBRITS and NAOMI both adopt bidirectional RNN structures.

It is also the first research to exploit that, RNN can model multivariable time series with the informativeness\nfrom the time series. \nFormer works like  attempted to impute missing values with RNN by concatenating timestamps and raw data, i.e., regard \ntimestamps as one attribute of raw data. But in , the concept \\textbf{time lag} is first proposed. \nIn this paper, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is first adopted to generate missing values. In each layer of GRU, since the input can contain missing values, \nthey replace the input $x_{t_i}^j$ with a combination of the existing values $x_{t_i}^j$ and statistical values, element-wise multiplied with $\\mathbf{M}$ \nand $\\mathbf{1}-\\mathbf{M}$ respectively.\n$$\nx_{t_i}^{j} \\leftarrow m_{t_i}^{j} x_{t_i}^{j}+\\left(1-m_{t_i}^{j}\\right) \\tilde{x}^{j}\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{x}$ can be one of the mean value, last observed value or concatenation of $\\left[\\mathbf{x_i}; \\mathbf{m_i};\\delta_i\\right]$. \nThe main contribution of this paper is the GRU based model GRU-D and the proposition of \\textbf{decay rate}.\nTo address the imputation of the missing values, they discover that \n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item The missing variables tend to be close to some default value if its last observation happens a long time ago. \n  \\item The influence of the input variables will fade away over time if the variable has been missing for a while.\n  \\end{itemize}\nAnd then they propose \\textbf{decay rate} $\\gamma$, which is defined as below \n$$\n\\gamma_{t_i} = \\exp({-\\max{(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{W}_{\\gamma}\\mathbf{\\delta_{t_i}})}})\n$$\nThe decay rate tries to model the impact of the other values have on the missing values. In brief, it guarantees that the larger the time intervals are, \nthe less their influence on imputing the missing values. And then they replace the input variable as  \n$$\nx_{t_i}^{j} \\leftarrow m_{t_i}^{j} x_{t_j}^{j}+\\left(1-m_{t_i}^{j}\\right) \\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t_i}}^{j} x_{t_i^{\\prime}}^{j}+\\left(1-m_{t_i}^{j}\\right)\\left(1-\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t_i}}^{j}\\right) \\tilde{x}^{j}\n$$ \nTherefore, as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:GRUD}, the GRU-D model is proposed with 2 different trainable decays $\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{h}}$, where \n$\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ is the input decay rate and the $\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{h}}$ is the decay rate for the hidden state.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\subfigure[GRU]{\n    \\label{fig:GRUD1}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\figwidths]{./fig-GRUD-1}\n  }\n  \\subfigure[GRU-D]{\n    \\label{fig:GRUD2}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\figwidths]{./fig-GRUD-2}\n  }\n  \\caption{Model of GRU and GRU-D.
