Another approach that has gained traction recently is based on reducing the complexity of the self-attention component of transformer-based language models .\nAll effective, modern, end-to-end document understanding systems present in the literature integrate multiple deep neural network architectures for both reading and comprehending a document's content. Since documents are made for humans, not machines, practitioners must combine CV as well as NLP architectures into a unified solution. While specific use cases will dictate the exact techniques used, a full end-to-end system employs:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item A computer-vision based document layout analysis module, which partitions each document page into distinct content regions. This model not only delineates between relevant and irrelevant regions, but also serves to categorize the type of content it identifies.\n    \\item An optical character recognition (OCR) model, whose purpose is to locate and faithfully transcribe all written text present in the document. Straddling the boundary between CV and NLP, OCR models may either use document layout analysis directly or solve the problem in an independent fashion.\n    \\item Information extraction models that use the output of OCR or document layout analysis to comprehend and identify relationships between the information that is being conveyed in the document.

For digit recognition for instance, this is the most intuitive approach~.\nOtherwise, $V$ can also correspond to a set of words, similarly to a word-level language modeling problem~. \nIn both cases, the problem can be framed as a multi-class classification problem with the number of classes equal to the size of the vocabulary $V$.\nWord-level text transcription models require more data as the number of classes in the multi-class classification problem is much larger than for character-level. On one hand, predicting words instead of characters decreases the probability of making small typos (like replacing an \"a\" by an \"o\" in a word like \"elephant\"). On the other, limiting oneself to a word-level vocabulary means that it is not possible to transcribe words which are not part of this vocabulary. This problem doesn't exist at the character-level, as the number of characters is limited. As long as we know the language of the document, it is straightforward to build a vocabulary which contains all the possible characters. Subword units are a viable alternative~, as they alleviate the issues present in both word and character level transcription. \nRecently the research community has moved towards using recurrent neural networks, specifically recurrent models with LSTM or GRU units on top of a convolutional image feature extractor~.\nTo transcribe a token, two different decoding mechanisms are often used.\nOne is standard greedy decoding or beam search using an attention-based sequence decoder with cross entropy loss~, exactly like decoding with a conditional language model.\nSometimes images are poorly oriented or misaligned, reducing the effectiveness of standard sequence attention.\nTo overcome this,~ uses attention alignment, encoding spatial information of characters directly, while~ use spatial attention mechanisms directly.\nThe second way in which transcription decoding is often done is with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss~, a common loss function in speech which models repeated characters in sequence outputs well.\nThe majority of text transcription models borrow from advances in sequence modeling for both text and speech and often can utilize these advancements well with only minor adjustments.\nAs a result, practitioners seldom directly tackle this aspect relative to the other components of the document understanding task.", "cites": [243, 813, 815, 814, 812, 168, 8384], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7, "origin_cites_number": 10, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of text transcription in OCR by connecting key concepts across cited papers, such as vocabulary design, decoding mechanisms (CTC vs. attention-based), and spatial alignment approaches.

Table datasets typically have multiple tasks to perform~. The first task is table detection which involves localizing the bounding box containing the table(s) inside the document. The next task is table structure recognition, which requires extracting the row, column, and cell information into a common format. This can be taken one step further to table recognition, which requires understanding both the structural information as well as the content by classifying cells within the table itself~. As textual and visual features are equally important to properly extracting and understanding tables, many diverse methods have been proposed to perform this task.\nOne such proposal named TableSense performs both table detection and structure recognition~. \nTableSense uses a three stage approach: cell featurization, object detection with convolutional models, and an uncertainty-based active learning sampling mechanism. TableSense's proposed architecture for table detection performs significantly better than traditional methods in computer vision such as YOLO-v3 or Mask R-CNN~.\nSince this approach does not work well for general spreadsheets, ~ extend upon the previous work by using a multitask framework to jointly learn table regions, structural components of spreadsheets, and cell types.\nThey add an additional stage, which leverages language models to learn the semantic contents of table cells in order to flatten complex tables into a single standard format.\n propose TUTA, which focuses on understanding the content within tables after the structure has been determined. The authors present three new objectives for language model pretraining for table understanding by using tree-based transformers. The objectives introduced for pretraining are designed to help the model understand tables at the token, cell, and table level. The authors mask a proportion of tokens depending on the table cell for the model to predict, randomly mask particular cell headers for the model to predict the header string based on its location, and provide the table with context such as table titles or descriptions that may or may not be associated for the model to identify which contextual elements are positively associated with the table. The transformer architecture is modified to reduce distractions from attention by limiting the attention connections to items based on a cell's  hierarchical distance to another cell. Fine-tuning TUTA has demonstrated state of the art performance on multiple datasets for cell type classification.", "cites": [837, 830, 520, 836], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a structured overview of table extraction tasks and synthesizes key approaches from multiple papers, integrating them into a narrative about the progression from detection to content understanding.
