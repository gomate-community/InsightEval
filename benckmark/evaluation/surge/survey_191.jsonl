In 1842, Lady Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, who is recognized by many as the first computer programmer, issued what is now known as ``Lovelace’s Objection'' . She stated that the Analytical Engine (the digital programmable machine proposed by Charles Babbage ) \\textit{``has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform''} . Indeed, in the centuries that followed, numerous projects and studies have been undertaken with the aim of designing machines capable of ``originating something'' . We have witnessed the emergence of a specialized field in computer science, namely Computational Creativity , which concerns the study of the relationship between creativity and artificial systems .\nIn this context, the adoption of deep learning (DL) techniques has led to substantial breakthroughs in recent years. Vast computational power and very large amounts of available data are at the basis of the increasing success of deep generative models (i.e., generative models based on DL ). Indeed, generative deep learning technologies have been used to write newspaper articles\\footnote{\\url{www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3}}, generate human faces  and voices , design drugs and proteins , and even create artworks sold for hundred thousand dollars\\footnote{\\url{www.christies.com/features/a-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx}}.\nWhile it is apparent that current technologies are able to generate impressive outputs, at the same it is also possible to argue that they cannot be considered \\textit{creative} in general . In fact, the goal of generative deep learning is to produce synthetic data that closely resemble real ones fed in input . On the other hand, creativity involves novelty and diversity . While for some problems mere content generation  might be sufficient, for other tasks, e.g., in the Arts, the ability to create different (but still valuable) outputs is essential: a creative model can find practical applications in the arts and industrial design as support for artists, content creators, designers and researchers, just to name a few. Moreover, generating more diverse data might mitigate legal and ethical issues related to content reproduction .\n\\noindent \\textbf{Goal and contributions of the survey.} The goal of this survey is to present and critically discuss the state of the art in generative deep learning from the point of view of machine creativity. \nMoreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that explores how current DL models have been or can be used as a basis for both generation (i.e., producing creative artifacts) and evaluation (i.e., recognizing creativity in artifacts). \nThe contribution of this survey can be summarized as follows. After a brief overview of the meaning and definitions of creativity in Section \\ref{whatcreativityis},\nSection \\ref{generativemodels} presents an in-depth analysis of generative deep learning through the introduction of a new taxonomy and a critical analysis of machine creativity. Then, several machine learning (ML)-based methodologies for evaluating creativity are presented and discussed in Section \\ref{creativitymeasures}. Finally, Section \\ref{conclusion} concludes the paper, outlining open questions and research directions for the field.\n\\noindent \\textbf{Related surveys.} We now provide an overview of other surveys in areas related to the present work. For readers interested in a survey on deep generative models, we recommend ; for an analysis of the state of the art in evaluation in computational creativity,  is an essential reading; for a review on AI and creativity in general, we recommend~; for a practical view of generative deep learning, we suggest ; finally, for an in-depth examination of artistic AI works (also in human-computer co-creations ),  is a very comprehensive source of information.", "cites": [5892, 1515, 5891, 8020], "cite_extract_rate": 0.14814814814814814, "origin_cites_number": 27, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a general analytical overview of creativity and machine learning, referencing the broader historical and technical context.

By sampling from $p_{model}$, observations that appear to have been drawn from $p_{data}$ can be generated . Generative deep learning is just the application of deep learning techniques to form $p_{model}$.\nAt first glance, this definition appears to be incompatible with those presented in Section \\ref{whatcreativityis}. Indeed, mimicry is the opposite of novelty. However, what a generative model should aim at mimicking is the underlying distribution representative of the artifacts, and not the specific artifacts themselves; in other words, it should aim at learning the conceptual space defined by the cultural context considered. A generative model can be said to exhibit combinatorial creativity if it can sample new and valuable works that are combinations of real data and exploratory creativity if the works actually differ from real ones. Vice versa, transformational creativity emerges if and only if the distribution for sampling diverges in some way from the underlying one (e.g., due to a different training process, by altering the distribution after learning, or by changing the sampling technique). In summary, what matters is how the space of solutions is learned and how artifacts are sampled from it.\nIn this section, we aim at studying the level of creativity of existing generative deep learning models. Following the discussion above, we analyze how the models learn their spaces of solutions and how the observations are generated from them. A new generative deep learning taxonomy is then introduced based on the different training and sampling techniques at the basis of each method. Figure \\ref{fig:models} provides a summary of the seven generative classes considered in this survey. Since our focus is on machine creativity, we do not discuss the implementation details of each class of methods. We instead present the \\textit{core concepts} at the basis of each class; some relevant \\textit{examples of models}; potential \\textit{applications}; and a \\textit{critical discussion} evaluating the level of machine creativity considering the definitions above.\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{images/generative_models.pdf}\n  \\caption{A schematic view of the seven classes of generative learning methods presented in this survey.

The former compresses high-dimensional input data into a latent space, i.e., a lower-dimensional space whose features are not directly observable, yet provide a meaningful representation. The latter decompresses the representation vector back to the original domain . Classic autoencoders directly learn to represent each input in a latent representation vector. Conversely, VAEs learn a (Gaussian) distribution over the possible values of the latent representation, i.e., the encoder learns the mean and the (log of the) variance of the distribution. \nVAEs are trained by optimizing two losses: the reconstruction loss and the regularization loss. The former is the log-likelihood of the real data $\\mathbf{x}$ from the decoder given their latent vectors $\\mathbf{z}$, i.e., it is the error of the decoder in reconstructing $\\mathbf{x}$. The latter is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the distribution learned by the encoder and a prior distribution, e.g., a Gaussian. Notably, the latent vector $\\mathbf{z}$ in input to the decoder is obtained by means of the so-called \\textit{reparameterization trick}, i.e., by sampling from the distribution defined by the mean and the variance. Without it, sampling would induce noise in the gradients required for learning .\nThe mathematical derivation of the whole loss has its roots in variational inference . Indeed, VAEs can be seen as an efficient and stochastic variational inference method, in which neural networks (NNs) and stochastic gradient descent are used to learn an approximation (i.e., the encoder) of the true posterior .\nIn VAEs, similar high-dimensional data are mapped to close distributions. This makes it possible to sample a random point $\\mathbf{z}$ from the latent space, and still obtain a comprehensible reconstruction . On the other hand, VAE tends to produce blurred images . It may also happen that high-density regions under the prior have a low density under the approximate posterior, i.e., these regions are not decoded to data-like samples . Finally, the objective can lead to overly simplified representations without using the entire capacity, obtaining only a sub-optimal generative model .", "cites": [5897, 5894, 2073, 5680, 5896, 5895, 8961], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7777777777777778, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple papers to explain the core concepts of VAEs, including their structure, training objectives, and limitations.

In the following, we focus on those relevant to our discussion on machine creativity.\nIn $\\beta$-VAE , a parameter $\\beta$ is used to scale the magnitude of the regularization loss, which allows a better disentanglement of the latent space . Another example is VAE-GAN , which merges VAE and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN; see Section \\ref{gan}) . This is done by treating the decoder as the generator of the GAN, thus training it by means of the GAN loss function. This leads to the generation of substantially less blurred images. Similarly, Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI)  merges VAE and GAN by asking the discriminator to distinguish between pairs of real data (and their latent representations) and pairs of sampled representations and synthetic data. Instead, Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE)  substitute the regularization loss with a discriminative signal, where the discriminator has to distinguish between random latent samples and encoded latent vectors. Another way to address the problem of ``sample blurriness'' is with PixelVAE , where the autoregressive PixelCNN  is used as the decoder. In , to deal with sequential data such as texts, where generation requires more steps, the encoder learns to produce a latent representation of a sentence, while the recurrent neural network RNN-based decoder learns to reproduce it word after word. However, VAE can also generate text by means of convolution and deconvolution .\nTo solve the problem of low-density regions, the authors of  propose an energy-based model called noise contrastive prior (NCP), trained by contrasting samples from the aggregate posterior to samples from a base prior.

An in-depth survey on GANs is~. \nIndeed, several refinements have been proposed in the past years, such as using deep convolutional networks~ or self-attention~, incrementally growing the networks , or scaling the model parameters . In the following, we present examples that are relevant to the issue of machine creativity.\nThe problem of non-meaningful representation has been addressed in different ways. For instance, InfoGAN  adds a latent code $\\mathbf{c}$ to $\\mathbf{z}$. An auxiliary model learns to predict $\\mathbf{c}$ given the sample generated by means of it. In this way, it can learn disentangled representations in a completely unsupervised manner. Another possibility is Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) . In order to include an inverse mapping from data to latent representation, an encoder is added to the architecture. The discriminator is then trained to distinguish between pairs of random noise and synthetic data and pairs of real data and latent encoding.\nIt is possible to condition the generation by means of a target content , a text , or even an image . In order to do so, it is sufficient to use the conditional information as input for both generator and discriminator~. Similarly, image-to-image translation is possible also without paired datasets. CycleGAN  trains two generators (from one domain to another, and vice versa) so that each of them produces images both from the target domain and correctly reconstructed by the counterpart.\nIn StyleGAN~, the generator architecture is re-designed in order to control the image synthesis process. The style of the image is adjusted at each layer based on the latent code (the specific intermediate code to control each layer is provided by a non-linear mapping network). This allows for the automatic separation of high-level attributes from stochastic variations in the generated images. It also allows for mixing regularization, where two latent codes are used alternatively to guide the generator. StyleGAN-V  builds on top of it to learn to produce videos by only using a few frames of it. To generate longer and more realistic motions, a two-stage approach can be used as well: first, a low-resolution generator is adversarially trained on long sequences; then, a high-resolution generator transforms a portion of the produced, low-resolution video in a high-resolution one .\nFinally, it is also worth mentioning variants that adapt GANs to sequential tasks (e.g., text generation). Since GANs require the generator to be differentiable, they cannot generate discrete data . However, several techniques have been proposed to avoid this problem. One possibility is to transform the discrete generation into a continuous one. Music can be processed like an image by considering its waveform (as in WaveGAN  and GANSynth ) or its musical score composed of tracks and bars (as in MuseGAN ). Music in a desired style can be obtained through conditional inputs.\nAnother possibility is to consider a soft-argmax function as an approximation of the inference for each step . TextGAN  uses it together with feature matching to learn the production of sentences. In place of the discriminative signal, it uses the difference between the latent feature distributions of real and synthetic sentences learned by the discriminator.\nAnother solution is to transform the GAN into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, as in Sequential GAN (SeqGAN)~. The generative model is the agent; the tokens generated so far form the state; the selection of the next token to be generated is the action to be performed; and the discriminative signal is the reward. The REINFORCE algorithm  can then be used to adversarially train the generative model. Other policy gradient methods can be used as well . \nOn the other hand, the learning signal (i.e., the reward) might be very sparse. A way to solve this issue is to use inverse RL~. For example, the authors of~ use inverse RL to learn a reward function able to associate positive rewards to real state-action pairs, and non-positive rewards to synthetic state-action pairs. Notably, this can help solve mode collapse too. Another variant is LeakGAN . Here, a hierarchical generator composed of a Manager and a Worker is used. The Worker produces a sentence conditioned by a goal vector provided by the Manager. The Worker and the discriminative model are trained following SeqGAN; the Manager is trained to predict goal vectors that lead to the identification of advantageous directions in the discriminative feature space. More specifically, the Manager receives a feature vector from the discriminator, i.e., its last convolutional layer, at each generated token. By means of this \\textit{leaked} information and the hierarchical architecture, LeakGAN produces longer and higher-quality texts. Finally, another possibility is to use Gumbel-softmax relaxation , as in Relational GAN (RelGAN) . Controlled TExt generation Relational Memory GAN (CTERM-GAN)  builds on the latter by also conditioning the generator on an external embedding input. In addition, it uses both a syntactic discriminator to predict whether a sentence is correct and a semantic discriminator to infer if a sentence is coherent with the external input.", "cites": [529, 8430, 8023, 1002, 5781, 896, 7194, 978, 1003, 3986, 5904, 1001, 62, 782, 5905, 9095, 56, 157, 4422, 8024, 7022], "cite_extract_rate": 0.65625, "origin_cites_number": 32, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.2, "critical": 3.3, "abstraction": 3.8}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes key GAN variants relevant to machine creativity, integrating concepts from multiple papers into a coherent overview.

The reason is that RNNs use internal states based on previous computation: inputs received at earlier time steps can affect the response to the current input. However, RNNs tend to perform worse with longer sequences~. LSTM is a specific RNN architecture that addresses the problem of long-term dependencies through the use of additional gates determining what to remember and what to forget at each step.\nRNNs can be used to model joint probabilities of characters (Char-RNN) ; words ; phonemes ; syllables ; and even tokens from transcriptions of folk music (Folk-RNN) . They can also receive conditional inputs like the encoding of the previous lines . Richer architectures that combine models focusing on different properties can be used to generate more complex text, e.g., poetry based on pentameter and rhymes . Finally, sequence modeling can also be combined with reinforcement learning. For example, the authors of  use a Note-RNN model (based on single notes) trained using Deep Q-Network ; as rewards, they consider both the classic loss of sequence prediction models and a reward based on rules of music theory. In this way, the model learns a set of composition rules, while still maintaining information about the transition probabilities of the training data. The advantages of adopting an RL-based approach are described in Section \\ref{rlbased}.\nDue to the difficulties in working with long sequences, results in tasks like narrative generation are affected by a lack of coherence . Many approaches have been proposed to address this problem. For instance, stories can be generated in terms of events  (i.e., tuples with subject, verb, object, and an additional \\textit{wildcard}) by an encoder-decoder RNN (also known as Sequence-to-Sequence, see ); events are modeled by another encoder-decoder RNN. Instead of events, it is also possible to focus on entities (i.e., vectors representing characters)~.\nSequence prediction models are also used for domains not commonly modeled as sequences, like images. Image modeling can be defined in a discrete way by means of a joint distribution of pixels: the model learns to predict the next pixel given all the previously generated ones. It starts at the top left pixel and then proceeds towards the bottom right. The two seminal architectures for sequence prediction of images are PixelRNN and PixelCNN . The former is a two-dimensional RNN (based on rows or diagonals). The latter is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an additional fixed dependency range (i.e., the convolution filters are masked in order to only use information about pixels above and to the left of the current one). To obtain better results, gated activation units can be used in place of rectified linear units between the masked convolutions; conditional inputs encoding high-level image descriptions can be used as well . Notably, the Gated PixelCNN architecture can also be used for other types of data: WaveNet  implements it to generate audio based on the waveform, possibly guiding the generation with conditional inputs.\nWhile intuitive in terms of architecture, RNNs are limited by the vanishing gradient problem and non-parallelizability in the time dimension . Very recent works explore solutions to tackle these issues by means of structured state spaces  and a combination of RNNs and Transformers  (see Section \\ref{transformers}).", "cites": [5910, 8835, 8027, 5909, 5911, 5912, 2401, 1252, 507, 4722], "cite_extract_rate": 0.47619047619047616, "origin_cites_number": 21, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.8, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.7}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section provides a well-structured overview of sequence prediction models in creativity, integrating multiple papers to discuss applications in poetry, music, and image generation.

They represent the main example of foundation models , because of the leading role they have been assuming in language, vision, and robotics. A Transformer is an architecture for sequential modeling that does not require recurrent or convolutional layers. Instead, it only relies on a self-attention mechanism  that models long-distance context without a sequential dependency. Each layer consists of multi-head attention (i.e., several self-attention mechanisms running in parallel), a feed-forward network, and residual connections. Since self-attention is agnostic to token order, a technique called positional embedding is used to capture the ordering .\nIn principle, a Transformer is nothing more than an autoregressive model: it works by predicting the current token given the previous ones (see Section \\ref{sequenceprediction}). However, few fundamental differences exist. A Transformer can also be trained by means of masked modeling: some of the input tokens are randomly masked, and the model has to learn how to reconstruct them from the entire context, and not only from the previous portions . The possibility of dealing with very long sequences allows for prompting. By providing a natural language prompt in input, the model can generate the desired output, e.g., the answer to a question, a class between a set of classes for a given text, or a poem in a particular style . This is done by simply passing the prompt in input as a text, and then leveraging the model to predict what comes next (e.g., the answer to a question).\nThese advantages, together with the very large amount of data available, the increasing computational power, and the parallelism induced by their architecture, have led Transformer-based models to become the state of the art for several tasks.

The design of specific Transformers for a variety of applications is presented in several surveys (e.g., ) and books (e.g., ).\nThe domain mostly influenced by Transformers is natural language processing (NLP). Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)  is a Transformer-based encoder trained for both predicting the next sentence (in an autoregressive fashion) and reconstructing masked tokens from the context. Several enhanced variations of the original model have been proposed, such as, for instance, solutions that remove the next-sentence pre-training objective , use inter-sentence coherence as an additional loss , or employ distillation  to train a smaller model .\nThe other main approach is that used by the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family . Here, a Transformer-based decoder is trained in an autoregressive way by additionally conditioning on the task of interest. After training, it can be used to perform a wide range of tasks by providing a description or a few demonstrations of the task. The effectiveness of this text-to-text generative approach has then been explored by T5 . Many other large language models  have been proposed to achieve better results by means of more parameters and computation , or more qualitative data . \nMixture of Experts  can be used as well in place of the feed-forward network to train a larger but lighter model (since only portions of it are used per task), as done by Generalist Language Model (GLaM) . Finally, Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART)  ideally merges together a BERT-encoder (trained by corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function) and a GPT-decoder (trained to reconstruct the original text autoregressively). Such an encoder-decoder architecture is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in machine translations, as well as other text-to-text tasks.\nTransformer-based models have been used in domains different from language modeling (LM). Few have been proposed for music generation. One of the first examples was Music Transformer , which can generate one-minute music in Bach's style with internal consistency; another remarkable one is Musenet , which is able to produce 4-minute musical composition with a GPT-2 architecture; and, finally, it is worth mentioning Jukebox , which can generate multiple minutes of music from raw audio by training a Sparse Transformer  (i.e., a Transformer with sparse factorization of the attention matrix in order to reduce from quadratic to linear scaling) over the low-dimensional discrete space induced by a VQ-VAE. Conditioning is always considered by means of genre, author, or instruments. MusicLM  additionally allows to generate music from text descriptions by aligning text and audio representation from different state-of-the-art models .\nAnother important application domain is video-making. Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)  generates videos using classic Transformer architectures; Video Transformer (VidTr)  achieves state-of-the-art performance thanks to the standard deviation-based pooling method; and VideoGPT  does so by learning discrete latent representations of raw video with VQ-VAE, and then training a GPT autoregressively. \nTransformers have been highly influential in computer vision too. The first model was Image Transformer . It restricts the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods, so larger images can be processed. Class-conditioned generation is also supported, by passing the embedding of the relative class in input. To avoid restricting self-attention to local neighborhoods, Vision Transformer~ divides an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embeds each of them, adds position embeddings, and then feeds the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder. Masked Autoencoders (MAE)  instead uses an encoder-decoder architecture based on Transformers trained with masked image modeling (i.e., to reconstruct randomly masked pixels). A BERT adaptation to images called Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers (BEiT)  has also been proposed. Masked image modeling has also been used together with classic autoregressive loss . Conversely, Vector Quantised-GAN (VQ-GAN)  allows a Transformer to be based on vector quantization. A GAN learns an effective codebook of image constituents. To do so, the generator is implemented as an auto-encoder; vector quantization is applied over the latent representation returned by the encoder. It is then possible to efficiently encode an image in a sequence corresponding to the codebook indices of their embeddings. The Transformer is finally trained on that sequence to learn long-range interactions. These changes also allow us to avoid quadratic scaling, which is intractable for high-resolution images. Finally, DALL-E  takes advantage of a discrete VAE. To generate images based on an input text, it learns a discrete image encoding; it concatenates the input text embedding with the image encoding; it learns autoregressively on them. CogView implements a similar architecture~.\nFinally, Transformer-based models have also been used in multimodal settings, in which data sources are of different types. A survey can be found in . The first examples of these systems consider text and images together as the output of the Transformer architecture. By aligning their latent representations, images and texts can be generated by Transformer-based decoders given a multimodal representation. For instance,  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)  has an image encoder pre-trained together with a text encoder to generate a caption for an image. A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-text embedding (ALIGN) , based on similar mechanisms, can achieve remarkable performance through training based on a noisier dataset. In~ the authors propose a frozen language model for multimodal few-shot learning: a vision encoder is trained to represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, so that the frozen language model prompted with this embedding can generate the appropriate caption. In~ the authors present Bridging-Vision-and-Language (BriVL), which performs multimodal tasks by learning from weak semantic correlation data. Finally, there is a trend toward even more complex multimodal models. For example, Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT)  learns to extract multimodal representations from video, audio, and text; instead, Gato  serializes all data (e.g., text, images, games, other RL-related tasks) into a flat sequence of tokens that is then embedded and passed to a standard large-scale language model. Similarly, Gemini  achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal tasks by working on interleaved sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs;  extends it to Mixture-of-Experts setting. Finally, NExT-GPT  handles any combination of four modalities (text, audio, image, and video) by connecting a language model with multimodal adaptors and diffusion decoders (see Section \\ref{diffusion}).", "cites": [5915, 1469, 8030, 5247, 793, 2564, 856, 1639, 681, 826, 1550, 2513, 8029, 8028, 1470, 4765, 3003, 2204, 1456, 680, 7040, 679, 8727, 7, 8033, 9149, 7361, 8031, 1150, 5914, 5916, 8032, 7463, 5342, 9, 732, 1552], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7872340425531915, "origin_cites_number": 47, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of various Transformer-based models across different domains, showing some synthesis by grouping them into categories (e.g., NLP, music, vision).

The most representative approach is the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) .

Each timestep $t$ corresponds to a certain noise level; $\\mathbf{x_t}$ can be seen as a mixture of $\\mathbf{x_0}$ with some noise $\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$ whose ratio is determined by $t$.

In other words, it learns to associate points from a predefined random distribution with real data through iterative denoising. Because of this, at inference time, a diffusion model can generate a new sample by starting from pure random noise. The generation can also be conditioned by simply modifying the noise perturbation so that it depends on the conditional information. However, this iterative sampling process might potentially lead to slow generation; a proposed solution is to induce self-consistency, i.e., ensuring that points on the same trajectory map to the same initial ones . In this way, the output can be obtained in a single step.\nThe aforementioned diffusion process is similar to the one followed by score-based generative models .

In order to generate higher-quality images and to allow text-to-image generation, a variety of effective methods for conditioning have been proposed. \nA possibility is to use classifier guidance : the diffusion score (i.e., the added noise) includes the gradient of the log-likelihood of an auxiliary classifier model. An alternative is classifier-free guidance : to avoid learning an additional model, a single neural network is used to parameterize two diffusion models, one conditional and one unconditional; the two models are then jointly trained by randomly setting the class for the unconditional model. Finally, the sampling is performed using a linear combination of conditional and unconditional score estimates. Guided Language to Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing (GLIDE)  demonstrates how classifier-free guidance can be effectively used to generate text-conditional images. In addition, it shows how diffusion models can be used for image editing by fine-tuning in order to reconstruct masked regions. Performance improvement can be obtained by means of a cascade of multiple diffusion models performing conditioning augmentation . Notably, the diffusion model can operate on latent vectors instead of real images. Stable Diffusion  employs a diffusion model in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder. Similarly, DALL-E 2  generates images by conditioning with image representations. At first, it learns a prior diffusion model to generate possible CLIP image embeddings from a given text caption, i.e., conditioned by its CLIP text embedding. Then, a diffusion decoder produces images conditioned by the image embedding. The generation quality can be further improved by means of generated captions for the images in the training set . Imagen  uses instead a cascaded diffusion decoder, together with a frozen language model as a text encoder to increase the quality of output.\nAlthough the approach is particularly suitable for images, applications to other data sources have been developed as well. DiffWave  and WaveGrad  use diffusion models to generate audio. They overcome the continuous-discrete dichotomy by working on waveform. Another possibility is to use an auto-encoder like MusicVAE  to transform the sequence into a set of continuous latent vectors, on which training a diffusion model .

Also  follows this path by using rewards like fluency, coherence, meaningfulness, and overall quality to generate poems. Another possibility is to use the metrics used at test time (e.g., BLEU or ROUGE) . Instead, RL-DUET  casts online music accompaniment generation as an RL problem with an ensemble of reward models, i.e., autoregressive models trained with or without the whole context, and with or without the human-produced counterpart. In this way, inter-coherence (between humans and machines) and intra-coherence can be obtained. Finally, Intelli-Paint  can paint in human style by using a sequential planner that learns a painting policy to predict vectorized brushstroke parameters from the current state.\nRL can also be used to fine-tune a pre-trained generative model. Doodle-SDQ  first learns to draw simple strokes using supervised learning; then, it improves its generation by means of rewards about similarity, color, and line movement. Conversely, the authors of  suggest to consider a pre-trained LSTM language model as a policy model. Fine-tuning then aims at maximizing the probability that a given event occurs at the end of the narrative. RL Tuner  uses RL to fine-tune a Note-RNN  to produce music that follows a set of music theory rules. To avoid forgetting note probabilities learned from the data, the probability value returned by a copy of the pre-trained Note-RNN can be used as an additional reward. Sequence Tutor  generalizes this idea of learning a policy that trades off staying close to the data distribution while improving performance on specific metrics. A comprehensive critical discussion of the rewards for RL-based generative models can be found in .\nFinally, RL can be used to help models follow human preferences  or feedback. The latter technique is referred to as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) . For example, ChatGPT  is an interactive version of GPT-3  (initially) and GPT-4  (at the time of writing), fine-tuned to maximize a learned reward of human values. RLHF improves its conversational skills while mitigating mistakes and biases; because of this, it has become a standard de facto for fine-tuning large language models, e.g., in .

The main example is VQGAN-CLIP . Given a text description, VQGAN produces a candidate image from a random latent vector; the vector is then optimized by minimizing the distance between the embeddings of the description and the candidate image. Both embeddings are computed using CLIP . Variants can be implemented as in Wav2CLIP , where an audio encoder is learned to match the CLIP encoders so that VQGAN-CLIP can be used from raw audio; or as in music2video , where videos are generated from audio a frame after the other by both minimizing the distance between subsequent frames, and the distance between image and music segment embedded by Wav2CLIP. In addition to the random latent vector, the text or audio description can be optimized as well. This can be performed by the users through many iterations of careful adjustments, or by means of an automated procedure. The latter is commonly known as prompt tuning. Prompt tuning is about producing prompts via backpropagation; the optimized prompts can then condition frozen language models in order to perform specific tasks without having to fine-tune them . An additional model can also be trained to output the desired prompt . Finally, image generators such as VQGAN can also be exploited in other ways, i.e., with binary-tournament genetic algorithm  or more complex evolution strategies . Another possibility is to optimize the input so that the generated output maximizes a target neuron of an image classifier . This helps generate what that neuron has learned. The desired latent vector can also be produced by an additional model .\nThe second approach consists of optimizing the inputs to transform them into the desired outputs. DeepDream  generates ``hallucinated'' images by modifying the input to maximize the activation of a certain layer from a pre-trained classifier. Artistic style transfer is based on the same idea. Given an input image and a target image, the former is modified by means of both style and content losses thanks to a pre-trained classifier. The content loss is minimized if the current and the original input images generate the same outputs from the hidden layers. The style loss is minimized if the current and target images have the same pattern of correlation between feature maps in the hidden layers .

We have discussed how the presence of a recognition model (e.g., a discriminative model or a reward model) helps ensure the value of the products. In the same way, novelty and surprise can be fostered by the integration of other components.\nA straightforward way to obtain novel and surprising outputs is to train a generative model by means of novelty and surprise objectives. This is the core idea behind Creative Adversarial Network (CAN) . In addition to the classic discriminative signal, i.e., a value loss, the generator is also trained to optimize a novelty loss. This is defined as the deviation from style norms, i.e., the error related to the prediction of the style of the generated image. The sum of the two training signals helps the model learn to produce artworks that are different (in style) from the training data. The same approach has been used to develop a creative StyleGAN, i.e., StyleCAN . \nAnother, very simple way to augment the training signal of a generative model with \\textit{creativity-oriented} objectives is by means of RL-based methods.\nThe choice of the reward structure is the fundamental element in the design of effective generative reinforcement learning systems. Rewards should teach the model to generate an output with a high level of novelty and surprise. An example is ORGAN , where appropriate reward functions can be used. For instance, statistical measures (e.g., Chi-squared) or metrics of distance between distributions (e.g., KL divergence) might be used to ground ideas of novelty and surprise.\nAnother possibility is the development of an input-based method where the input is optimized to obtain a product that is valuable, novel, and surprising. This may be achieved either by forcing a further exploration of the latent space (e.g., by means of evolutionary search ), or by defining appropriate loss functions to perform gradient descent over the input. All these methodologies are also called \\textit{active divergence}  since they aim to generate in ways that do not simply reproduce training data. A survey on active divergence can be found in . A different output can also be obtained by carefully altering the probability distribution of the model, e.g., by scaling its probabilities with learned functions to maximize target properties .\nA different approach is followed by the Composer-Audience architecture . Two models are considered: the Audience, a simple sequence prediction model trained on a given dataset; the Composer, another sequence prediction model trained on a different dataset. In addition, the Composer also receives the next-token expectations from the Audience, and it learns when to follow its guidance and when to diverge from expectations, i.e., when to be surprising. For instance, it can learn to produce jokes by considering non-humorous texts to train the Audience, and humorous texts to train the Composer. Even though this approach is useful for learning how to generate valuable and surprising output, it is only applicable when paired datasets are available.\n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n        \\toprule\n        Generative family & Type of creativity & Boden's criteria & Creative suggestions \\\\\n        \\midrule\n        VAE & Exploratory & \\specialcell[l]{$\\pmb{\\sim}$ Value \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Novelty \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Surprise} & \\specialcell{Creativity-oriented \\\\ input-based methods} \\\\ \n        \\cmidrule(r){1-4}\n        GAN & Exploratory & \\specialcell[l]{$\\pmb{\\checkmark}$ Value \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Novelty \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Surprise} & \\specialcell{CAN; \\\\ Creativity-oriented \\\\ input-based methods} \\\\\n        \\cmidrule(r){1-4}\n        \\specialcell{Sequence \\\\ prediction \\\\ model} & \\specialcell{Combinatorial, \\\\ Exploratory} & \\specialcell[l]{$\\pmb{\\sim}$ Value \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Novelty \\\\ $\\pmb{\\times}$ Surprise} & \\specialcell{Composer-Audience; \\\\ Creativity-oriented \\\\ RL-based methods} \\\\ \n        \\cmidrule(r){1-4}\n        \\specialcell{Transformer-\\\\ based \\\\ models} & \\specialcell{Combinatorial, \\\\ Exploratory, \\\\ Transformational} & \\specialcell[l]{$\\pmb{\\sim}$ Value \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Novelty \\\\ $\\pmb{\\times}$ Surprise} & \\specialcell{Creativity-oriented \\\\ prompt tuning or \\\\ RL-based methods} \\\\\n        \\cmidrule(r){1-4}\n        \\specialcell{Diffusion \\\\ models} & Exploratory & \\specialcell[l]{$\\pmb{\\sim}$ Value \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Novelty \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Surprise} & \\specialcell{Creativity-oriented \\\\ input-based methods} \\\\\n        \\cmidrule(r){1-4}\n        \\specialcell{RL-based \\\\ methods} & \\specialcell{Combinatorial, \\\\ Exploratory, \\\\ Transformational} & \\specialcell[l]{$\\pmb{\\checkmark}$ Value \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Novelty \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Surprise} & \\specialcell{Intrinsic rewards; \\\\ Novelty-based rewards} \\\\\n        \\cmidrule(r){1-4}\n        \\specialcell{Input-based \\\\ methods} & \\specialcell{Exploratory, \\\\ Transformational} & \\specialcell[l]{$\\pmb{\\checkmark}$ Value \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Novelty \\\\ $\\pmb{\\sim}$ Surprise} & \\specialcell{Evolutionary search; \\\\ Novelty-based optimization} \\\\\n        \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Summary of all the methods explained so far, considering their type of creativity as discussed in the corresponding subsections; the possible presence of Boden's criteria ($\\pmb{\\checkmark}$ if induced by the training process; $\\pmb{\\sim}$ if not considered; $\\pmb{\\times}$ if excluded); and some practical suggestions to achieve a higher degree of creativity.}\n    \\label{tab:table_generative_models}\n\\end{table}\nAs far as the type of creativity is concerned, there can be ways to achieve a better exploration or even transformation of the space of solutions. For example, since CAN novelty loss is used during training, it learns to diverge from the distribution of real data. The same is true for RL-based methods with novelty and surprise rewards (especially if the training happens from scratch). Finally, a more explored or transformed space may be reached using RL-based methods driven by curiosity : an agent can learn to be creative and discover new patterns thanks to intrinsic rewards to measure novelty, interestingness, and surprise. This can be done by training a predictive model of the growing data history and by using its learning progress as the reward. In this way, the agent is motivated to make things the predictor does not yet know. If an external qualitative reward is considered as well, the agent should in theory learn to do things that are new, but still valuable . The same idea can also be applied to different techniques like evolutionary strategies . Deep Learning Novelty Explorer (DeLeNoX)  uses a denoising autoencoder to learn low-dimensional representations of the last generated artifacts. Then, a population of candidate artifacts (in terms of their representation) is evolved through a feasible-infeasible novelty search  in order to maximize the distances between them, i.e., to increase their novelty, while still considering qualitative constraints. Other evolutionary strategies might be considered as well to search the space of artifacts for novel  and surprising  results. Instead of relying on manually crafted metrics, Quality Diversity through Human Feedback (QDHF)  uses human feedback for computing quality and distance in learned latent projection for computing diversity. Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF)  makes the model more independent in searching and innovating by totally relying on its own feedback for both quality and diversity.\nTable \\ref{tab:table_generative_models} summarizes all the generative approaches discussed in this section, highlighting their characteristics from a machine creativity perspective.", "cites": [8048, 8047, 8040, 5938, 2499, 8046, 7353, 3135], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4, "origin_cites_number": 20, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.5, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple papers by connecting creativity-oriented methods like CAN, RL-based approaches, and evolutionary strategies under a unified framework.

For each of them, we explore the core concepts, the dimensions of creativity that are considered, the evaluation protocol, and, finally, we critically assess them.\nThe presence of several different proposals can be associated with the fact that it is not always straightforward to determine the ‘‘right’’ question to ask in an evaluation of a creative artifact .

As demonstrated by , moving back an artwork has the effect of increasing its creativity; however, this appears conceptually wrong. As discussed in , the time location of an artwork is fundamental in the quantification of its creativity.

Firstly, we have introduced the concept of machine creativity, including key concepts and definitions. Secondly, we have described a variety of generative learning techniques, considering their potential applications and limitations. Finally, we have discussed several evaluation frameworks for quantifying machine creativity, highlighting their characteristics and the dimensions they are able to capture.\nEven if the field of machine creativity has witnessed increasing interest and popularity in recent years, there are still several open challenges. First of all, an interesting direction is the exploration of  \\textit{creativity-oriented} objective functions, to directly train models to be creative or to navigate the induced latent space to find creative solutions. Another open problem is the definition of techniques to explore or transform the space of solutions. \nA fundamental area is the definition of novel and robust evaluation techniques for both generated and real artifacts. As discussed in Section \\ref{creativitymeasures}, deep learning might be used as a basis for the definition of metrics for machine creativity.\nIt should be noted that there is also an ongoing debate about the role of human versus machine evaluation .\nAnother promising research direction concerns the machine interpretation of art . Moreover, machine learning techniques might also be used to investigate psychological dimensions of creativity~.\nThere are also foundational questions related to generative deep learning and copyright . For example, it is not clear if machine-generated works could be protected by Intellectual Property, and, if they are, who should be the owner of the related rights . In addition, other problems concerning copyright should be considered, such as if and when training over protected work is permitted . \nAnother important ongoing debate is about authorship and the human role in creative fields in the era of AI\\footnote{This is one of the ethical dilemmas highlighted by UNESCO in its \\href{https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367823}{Preliminary study on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence}.}.\nThe models and framework discussed in this work show the remarkable potential of generative learning for machine creativity. We hope that this survey will represent a valuable guide for researchers and practitioners working in this fascinating area.\n\\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}\n\\bibliography{main}\n\\end{document}\n\\endinput", "cites": [5940], "cite_extract_rate": 0.16666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a coherent analytical overview of current challenges and future directions in machine creativity, referencing broader themes like evaluation frameworks and copyright.
