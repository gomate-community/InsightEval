Advances in the past decade in computations, data sets, and algorithms have driven many advances for machine learning and its application to many different areas. \n\\begin{figure}[th]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3in]{AIarchitecture.png}\n    \\caption{Canonical AI architecture consists of sensors, data conditioning, algorithms, modern computing, robust AI, human-machine teaming, and users (missions). Each step is critical in developing end-to-end AI applications and systems.}\n    \\label{fig:architecture}\n  \\end{figure}\nAI systems bring together a number of components that must work together to effectively provide capabilities for use by decision makers, warfighters, and analysts~. \nFigure~\\ref{fig:architecture} captures this system and its components of an end-to-end AI solution. \nOn the left side of Figure~\\ref{fig:architecture}, structured and unstructured data sources provide different views of entities and/or phenomenology. \nThese raw data products are fed into a data conditioning step in which they are fused, aggregated, structured, accumulated, and converted to information. The information generated by the data conditioning step feeds into a host of supervised and unsupervised algorithms such as neural networks, which extract patterns, predict new events, fill in missing data, or look for similarities across datasets, thereby converting the input information to actionable knowledge. This actionable knowledge is then passed to human beings for decision-making processes in the human-machine teaming phase. The phase of human-machine teaming provides the users with useful and relevant insight turning knowledge into actionable intelligence or insight. \nUnderpinning this system are modern computing systems, for which Moore's law trends have ended~, as have a number of related laws and trends including Denard's scaling (power density), clock frequency, core counts, instructions per clock cycle, and instructions per Joule (Koomey's law)~. However, advancements and innovations are still progressing in the form of specialized circuits and chips that accelerate often-used operational kernels, methods, or functions.  These accelerators are designed with a different balance between performance and functional flexibility. This includes an explosion of innovation in ML processors and accelerators~. Understanding the relative benefits of these technologies is of particular importance to applying AI to domains under significant constraints such as size, weight, and power, both in embedded applications and in data centers. \nThis paper is an update to last year's IEEE-HPEC paper~. Quite a number more accelerator chips have been announced and released, and other technologies like neuromorphic architectures, memory-based analog acceleration, and computing with light are gaining attention. There are also some technology categories that were included in last year's paper that will not be included this year, namely most FPGA-based inference instances~ and smartphone accelerators. Only FPGA-based offerings that have some dynamic programmability are considered in this paper (e.g., Intel Arria, AImotive, and Microsoft Brainwave). Smartphone accelerators are not being considered this year because they cannot be used in a different platform without significant re-engineering. \nBefore getting to the accelerators, we will review a few topics pertinent to understanding the capabilities of the accelerators. We must discuss the types of neural networks for which these ML accelerators are being designed; the distinction between neural network training and inference; the numerical precision with which the neural networks are being used for training and inference, and how neuromorphic accelerators fit into the mix: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Types of Neural Networks -- While AI and machine learning encompass a wide set of statistics-based technologies~, this paper continues with last year's focus on processors that are geared toward deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  Overall, the most emphasis of computational capability for machine learning is on DNN and CNNs because they are quite computationally intensive~, and because most of the computations are dense matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplies, they are primed to take advantage of computational architectures that exploit data reuse, data locality, and data density. \n\\item Neural Network Training versus Inference -- As was explained in last year's survey, neural network training uses libraries of input data to converge model weight parameters by applying the labeled input data (forward projection), measuring the output predictions and then adjusting the model weight parameters to better predict output predictions (back projection).  Neural network inference is using a trained model of weight parameters and applying it to input data to receive output predictions. Processors designed for training may also perform well at inference, but the converse is not always true. \n\\item Numerical Precision -- The numerical precision with which the model weight parameters and model input data are stored and computed has an impact on the accuracy and efficiency with which networks are trained and used for inference. Generally higher numerical precision representations, particularly floating point representations, are used for training, while lower numerical precision representations, (in particular, integer representations) have been shown to be reasonably effective for inference~. However, it is still an open research question whether very limited numerical precisions like int4, int2, and int1 adequately represent model weight parameters and significantly affect model output predictions. Over the past year, more training accelerators have been released that support 16-bit floating point numbers (fp16 and bfloat16), and most inference accelerators now release performance results for 8-bit integer (int8) operands, particularly the inference accelerators geared at edge and embedded processing applications.  \n\\item Neuromorphic Computing -- The field of neuromophic computing emerged from the neuroscience field, in which researchers and engineers design circuits to model biological and physiological mechanisms in brains. Schuman's survey~ provides a rich background of all of the significant efforts in the field over the past several decades. Some of the most prominent features of neuromorphic circuits are synthetic neurons and synapses along with spiking synapse signaling, and many agree that the spiking synapse signal is the most prominent feature, especially when implemented in neural network accelerators. \nIn recent accelerators, these spiking signals are usually encoded as digital signals, e.g., IBM TrueNorth chip~, University of Manchester SpiNNaker~, and Intel's Loihi~. Another recent notable research accelerator is the Tianjic research chip~, developed by a team at Tsinghua University, which demonstrated the capability of choosing either a spiking neural network (SNN) layer or non-spiking artificial neural network (ANN) layer to instantiate each layer of a DNN model for inference. The team showed that for certain models for audio and video processing a hybrid layer-by-layer approach was most effective, both in accuracy and power consumption. Finally, a startup called Knowm is developing a new neuromorphic computational framework called AHaH Computing (Anti-Hebbian and Hebbian) based on memristor technology~. Their goal is to use this technology to dramatically reduce SWaP for machine learning applications. \n\\end{itemize}\nThere are many surveys~ and other papers that cover various aspects of AI accelerators; this paper focuses on gathering a comprehensive list of AI accelerators with their computational capability, power efficiency, and ultimately the computational effectiveness of utilizing accelerators in embedded and data center applications, as did last year's paper. Along with this focus, this paper mainly compares neural network accelerators that are useful for government and industrial sensor and data processing applications. Therefore, it will make a distinction between research accelerators and commercially available accelerators, and it will focus comparisons on the latter. Research accelerators are developed by university and industry researchers to demonstrate the art of the possible, often with the intent of influencing commercial attention to technology developments or to attract venture funding to commercialize their developed technology. But before either of these intents are realized, the demonstration of the art of the possible show us opportunities in which commercial products may pursue for improved capabilities and features.", "cites": [7633, 7632, 7629, 7630, 7631], "cite_extract_rate": 0.17857142857142858, "origin_cites_number": 28, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple cited papers to provide a coherent overview of machine learning accelerators, particularly focusing on DNNs and CNNs.

While it offers some critical remarks, such as noting the open research question around low numerical precision, the analysis is more focused on explanation than deep critique."}}

This survey gathers performance and power information from publicly available materials including research papers, technical trade press, company benchmarks, etc. While there are ways to access information from companies and startups (including those in their silent period), this information is intentionally left out of this survey; such data will be included in this survey when it becomes publicly available. The key metrics of this public data are plotted in Figure~\\ref{fig:PeakPerformancePower}, which graphs recent processor capabilities (as of June 2020) mapping peak performance vs. power consumption. \nThe x-axis indicates peak power, and the y-axis indicate peak giga-operations per second (GOps/s). Note the legend on the right, which indicates various parameters used to differentiate computing techniques and technologies. The computational precision of the processing capability is depicted by the geometric shape used; the computational precision spans from analog and single-bit int1 to four-byte int32 and two-byte fp16 to eight-byte fp64. The precisions that show two types denotes the precision of the multiplication operations on the left and the precision of the accumulate/addition operations on the right (for example, fp16.32 corresponds to fp16 for multiplication and fp32 for accumulate/add). The form factor is depicted by  color; this is important for showing how much power is consumed, but also how much computation can be packed onto a single chip, a single PCI card, and a full system. Blue corresponds to a single chip; orange corresponds to a card (note that they all are in the 200-300 Watt zone); and green corresponds to entire systems (single node desktop and server systems). This survey is limited to single motherboard, single memory-space systems. Finally, the hollow geometric objects are peak performance for inference-only accelerators, while the solid geometric figures are performance for accelerators that are designed to perform both training and inference. \n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{2020-08-31_AI_Accelerators-AReuther-r3-ellipses.pdf}\n    \\caption{Peak performance vs. power scatter plot of publicly announced AI accelerators and processors.}\n    \\label{fig:PeakPerformancePower}\n  \\end{figure*}\nWe can make some general observations from Figure~\\ref{fig:PeakPerformancePower}. First, quite a number of new accelerator chips, cards, and systems have been announced and released in the past year. Each of the five categories have a higher density of entries from last year, and there is a greater diversity of underlying architectures and technologies with which these accelerators have been developed as you will notice in the descriptions below. Also, many more recent accelerators have broken through the 1 TeraOps/W boundary for peak performance. \nAn observation that has not changed from last year is that at least 100W must be employed to perform training; almost all of the points on the scatter plot below 100W are inference-only processors/accelerators. (Cornami is the one exception, but their plot point is based on simulation estimates.) It is generally understood that training requires floating point precision which requires more capable and power-consuming ALUs, datapaths, memories, etc.  \nWhen it comes to precision, there is an even wider variety of numerical precisions for which peak performance numbers have been released. There continues to be exploration about how much precision is necessary for neural networks to perform well even when using limited or mixed precision representation of activation functions, weights, and biases~. \nFinally, a reasonable categorization of accelerators follows their intended application, and the five categories are shown as ellipses on the graph, which roughly correspond to performance and power consumption: Very Low Power for speech processing, very small sensors, etc.; Embedded for cameras, small UAVs and robots, etc.; Autonomous for driver assist services, autonomous driving, and autonomous robots; Data Center Chips and Cards; and Data Center Systems. In the following listings, the angle-bracketed string is the label of the item on the scatter plot, and the square bracket after the angle bracket is the literature reference from which the performance and power values came. A few of the performance values are reported in frames per second (fps) with a given machine learning model. For translating fps values to performance values, Samuel Albanie's Matlab code and a web site of all of the major machine learning models with their operations per epoch/inference, parameter memory, feature memory, and input size~ were used.", "cites": [7198], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from cited papers and public sources to provide a structured overview of AI accelerators, particularly linking the discussion of numerical precision to its impact on training and inference.

However, critical analysis is limited—while it mentions observations, it does not deeply evaluate the strengths or limitations of the cited works or their claims."}}
