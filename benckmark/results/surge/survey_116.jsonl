A large number of consensus protocols, algorithms, and mechanisms have been reviewed and summarized in .  For example, motivated by lack of a comprehensive literature review regarding the consensus protocols for blockchain networks,  Wang \\textit{et al.}  emphasized on both the system design and the incentive mechanism behind those distributed blockchain consensus protocols such as Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)-based protocols and Nakamoto protocols. From a game-theoretic viewpoint, the authors also studied how such consensus protocols affect the consensus participants in blockchain networks.\n During the surveys of smart contracts , Atzei \\textit{et al.}  paid their attention to the security vulnerabilities and programming pitfalls that could be incurred in Ethereum smart contracts.\nDwivedi \\textit{et al.}  performed a systematic taxonomy on smart-contract languages, while Zheng  \\textit{et al.}  conducted a survey on the challenges, recent technical advances and typical platforms of smart contracts.\n Sharding techniques are viewed as promising solutions to solving the scalability issue and low-performance  problems of blockchains. Several survey articles   provide systematic reviews on sharding-based blockchain  techniques. For example,  Wang \\textit{et al.}  focused on the general design flow and critical design challenges of sharding protocols.\n Next, Yu \\textit{et al.}  mainly discussed the intra-consensus security, atomicity of cross-shard transactions, and other advantages of sharding mechanisms.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\t\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{./figures/classification.png}\n\t\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\caption{\\modified{The category and number

of blockchains including security of blockchain in different directions such as IoT, AI data and sidechain.\n Dasgupta \\textit{et al.}  discussed general security issues of blockchains from theory to implementation, such as vulnerability, malicious attacks, risks of blockchain applications, and etc.\n Ma \\textit{et al.}  focused on security, privacy and trust issues in crowdsourcing services.\n Under the background of big data, Tariq \\textit{et al.}  reviewed the security challenges of fog computing-enabled IoT applications, in which blockchain techniques are playing a role of security

In such a puzzle-solving process, also referred to as mining, miners need to calculate a nonce value that fits the required difficulty level  . Through changing the difficulty, Bitcoin system can maintain a stable rate of block-generation, which is about one block per 10 minutes.\n  When a miner generates a new block, it broadcasts this message to all the other miners in the network. If others receive this new block, they add this block to their local chain. If all of the other miners receive this new block timely, the length of the main chain increases by one. However, because of the network delays, not always all the other miners can receive a new block in time. When a miner generates a block before it receives the previous one, a fork yields. Bitcoin addresses this issue by following the rule of longest chain.\n  \\textbf{UTXO Model}. The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model is adopted by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and other popular blockchain systems . A UTXO is a set of digital money, each represents a chain of ownership between the owners and the receivers based on the cryptography technologies.\n  In a blockchain, the overall UTXOs form a set, in which each element denotes the unspent output of a transaction, and can be used as an input for a future transaction. A client may own multiple UTXOs, and the total coin of this client is calculated by summing up all associated UTXOs.\n   Using this model, blockchains can prevent the double-spend  attacks efficiently.", "cites": [7550], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 1.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a factual description of Bitcoin's key components (Nakamoto Consensus and UTXO model) and their mechanisms but does not effectively synthesize insights from the cited paper.

The key findings of this paper includes how to identify the singular blocks, and how to use singular blocks to reduce the confirmation delay. Once the confirmation delay is reduced, the throughput increases accordingly.\n Two obstacles have hindered the scalability of the cryptocurrency systems. The first one is the low throughput, and the other one is the requirement for every node to duplicate the communication, storage, and state representation of the entire blockchain network. Wang \\textit{et al.}   studied how to solve the above obstacles. Without weakening decentralization and security, the proposed Monoxide technique offers a linear scale-out ability by partitioning the workload. And they preserved the simplicity of the blockchain system and amplified its capacity. The authors also proposed a novel \\textit{Chu-ko-nu} mining mechanism, which ensures the cross-zone atomicity, efficiency and security of the blockchain system with thousands of independent zones. Then, the authors have conducted experiments to evaluate the scalability performance of the proposed Monoxide with respect to TPS, the overheads of  cross-zone transactions, the confirmation latency of transactions, etc.\n    To bitcoin, low \\textit{throughput} and long \\textit{transaction confirmation latency} are two critical bottleneck metrics. To overcome these two bottlenecks, Yang \\textit{et al.}   designed a new blockchain protocol called Prism, which achieves a scalable throughput as high as 70,000 transactions per second, while ensuring a full security of bitcoin. \n    The project of Prism is open-sourced in Github. The instances of Prism can be flexibly deployed on commercial cloud platform such as AWS.\n    However, the authors also admitted that although the proposed Prism has a high throughput, its confirming latency still maintains as large as 10 seconds since there is only a single \\textit{voter chain} in Prism. A promising solution is to introduce a large number of such voter chains, each of which is not necessarily secure. Even though every voter chain is under attacking with a probability as high as 30\\%, the successful rate of attacking a half number of all voter chains is still theoretically very low. Thus, the authors believed that using multiple voter chains would be a good solution to reducing the confirmation latency while not sacrificing system security.\n Considering that Ethereum simply allocates transactions to shards according to their account addresses rather than relying on the workload or the complexity of transactions, the resource consumption of transactions in each shard is unbalanced. In consequence, the network transaction throughput is affected and becomes low. To solve this problem, Woo \\textit{et al.}   proposed a heuristic algorithm named GARET, which is a gas consumption-aware relocation mechanism for improving throughput in sharding-based Ethereum environments. In particular, the proposed GARET can relocate transaction workloads of each shard according to the gas consumption. The experiment results show that GARET achieves a higher transactions throughput and a lower transaction latency compared with existing techniques.\n    }\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\caption{Latest Theories of Improving the Performance of Blockchains.}\n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{0.08\\textwidth}|p{0.03\\textwidth}|p{0.12\\textwidth}|p{0.23\\textwidth}|p{0.35\\textwidth}|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Emphasis} &\\textbf{Ref.} &\\textbf{Recognition} &\\textbf{{\\color{blue}Challenge}}& \\textbf{Methodology}\\\\\n\\hline\n\t\\multirow{11}*{Throughput} \n\t&        & ACCEL: Reduce the confirmation delay of blocks & {\\color{blue}Most of the blockchain applications desire fast confirmation of their transactions} & Authors proposed a high-throughput, low-latency, deterministic confirmation mechanism, aiming to accelerate Bitcoin's block confirmation. \\\\\n\t\\cline{2-5}\n\t\\multirow{6}*{\\& Latency} &      & Monoxide & {\\color{blue}Scalability issues, and efficient processing of cross-shard transactions} &  The proposed Monoxide offers a linear scale-out by partitioning workloads.

For example, the storage efficiency of original-version Bitcoin has received much criticism since it requires to store the full transaction history in each Bitcoin peer. Although some revised protocols advocate that only the full-size nodes store the entire copy of whole ledger, the transactions still consume a large storage space in those full-size nodes. To alleviate this problem, several pioneer studies proposed storage-efficient solutions for blockchain networks.\n For example,\n By exploiting the erasure code-based approach, Perard  \\textit{et al.}  proposed a low-storage blockchain mechanism, aiming to achieve a low requirement of storage for blockchains. The new low-storage nodes only have to store the linearly encoded fragments of each block. The original blockchain data can be easily recovered by retrieving fragments from other nodes under the erasure-code framework. Thus, this type of blockchain nodes allows blockchain clients to reduce the storage capacity. The authors also tested their system on the low-configuration Raspberry Pi to show the effectiveness, which demonstrates the possibility towards running blockchains on IoT devices.\n Then, Dai  \\textit{et al.}  proposed Jidar, which is a data reduction strategy for Bitcoin. In Jidar, each node only has to store the transactions of interest and the related Merkle branches from the complete blocks. All nodes verify transactions collaboratively by a query mechanism. This approach seems very promising to the storage efficiency of Bitcoin. Their experiments show that the proposed Jidar can  reduce the storage overhead of each peer \\modified{to} about 1\\% comparing with the original Bitcoin. \n Under the similar idea, Xu \\textit{et al.}  reduced the storage of blockchains using a \\textit{segment blockchain} mechanism, in which each node only needs to store a piece of blockchain segment. The authors also proved that the proposed mechanism endures a failure probability $(\\phi/n)^m$ if an adversary party commits a collusion with less than a number $\\phi$ of nodes and each segment is stored by a number $m$ of nodes. This theoretical result is useful for the storage design of blockchains when developing a particular segment mechanism towards data-heavy distributed applications.\n }", "cites": [2157, 2159], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes three different storage efficiency approaches, connecting their ideas under the broader theme of reducing blockchain storage requirements.

However, such availability guarantees of blockchain systems are unknown. To this end, Weber \\textit{et al.}  studied the availability limitations of two popular blockchains, i.e., Bitcoin and Ethereum. The authors found that the availability of reading and writing operations are conflict to each other. Through measuring and analyzing the transactions of Ethereum, they observed that the DApps could be stuck in an uncertain state while transactions are pending in a blockchain system. This observation suggests that maybe blockchains should support some built-in transaction-abort options for DApps. The authors finally presented techniques that can alleviate the availability limitations of Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains.\n In public blockchains, the system clients join the blockchain network basically through a third-party peer. Thus, the reliability of the selected blockchain peer is critical to the security of clients in terms of both resource-efficiency and monetary issues.

The solutions that use classical Byzantine consensus protocols do not work in an open environment like cryptocurrencies. To solve the above problems, Luu \\textit{et al.}  proposed a new distributed agreement protocol for the permission-less blockchains, called \\textit{Elastico}, which is viewed as the first secure candidate for a sharding protocol towards the open public blockchains that tolerate a constant fraction of byzantine-fault network nodes. The key idea in Elastico is to partition the network into smaller committees, each of which processes a disjoint set of transactions or a \\textit{shard}. The number of committees grows linearly in the total computational power of the network. Using Elastico, the blockchain's transaction throughput increases almost linearly with the computational power of the network.\n   Some early-stage sharding blockchain protocols (e.g., Elastico) improve the scalability by enforcing multiple groups of committees work in parallel. However, this manner still requires a large amount of communication for verifying every transaction linearly increasing with the number of nodes within a committee. Thus, the benefit of sharding policy was not fully employed. As an improved solution, Zamani \\textit{et al.}  proposed a Byzantine-resilient sharding-based protocol, namely Rapidchain, for permissionless blockchains. Taking the advantage of block pipelining, RapidChain improves the throughput by using a sound intra-committee consensus. The authors also developed an efficient cross-shard verification method to avoid the broadcast messages flooding in the holistic network.\n To enforce the throughput scaling with the network size, Gao \\textit{et al.}   proposed a scalable blockchain protocol, which leverages both sharding and Proof-of-Stake consensus techniques. Their experiments were performed in an Amazon EC2-based simulation network. Although the results showed that the throughput of the proposed protocol increases following the network size, the performance was still not so high, for example, the maximum throughput was 36 transactions per second and the transaction latency was around 27 seconds.\n Aiming to improve the efficiency of cross-shard transactions, Amiri \\textit{et al.}  proposed a permissioned blockchain system named \\textit{SharPer}, which is strive for the scalability of blockchains by dividing and reallocating different data shards to various network clusters. \n The major contributions of the proposed SharPer include the related algorithm and protocol associated to such SharPer model. In the author's previous work, they have already proposed a permissioned blockchain, while in this paper the authors extended it by introducing a consensus protocol in the processing of both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Finally, SharPer was devised by adopting sharding techniques. One of the important contributions is that SharPer can be used in the networks where there are a high percentage of non-faulty nodes. Furthermore, this paper also contributes a flattened consensus protocol w.r.t the order of cross-shard transactions among all involved clusters.\n Considering that the Ethereum places each group of transactions on a shard by their account addresses, the workloads and complexity of transactions in shards are apparently unbalanced. This manner further damages the network throughput. To address this uneven problem, Kim \\textit{et al.}  proposed D-GAS, which is a dynamic load balancing mechanism for Ethereum shards. Using such D-GAS, the transaction workloads of accounts on each shard can be reallocated according to their gas consumption. The target is to maximize the throughput of those transactions. The evaluation results showed that the proposed D-GAS achieved at most a 12\\% superiority of transaction throughput and a 74\\% lower transaction latency comparing with other existing techniques.\n}\n{\\color{black}\n The random sharding strategy causes imbalanced performance gaps among different committees in a blockchain network. Those gaps yield a bottleneck of transaction throughput. Thus, Wang \\textit{et al.}  proposed a new sharding policy for blockchains named NRSS, which exploits node rating to assess network nodes according to their performance of transaction verifications. After such evaluation, all network nodes will be reallocated to different committees aiming at filling the previous imbalanced performance gaps. Through the experiments conducted on a local blockchain system, the results showed that NRSS improves throughput by around 32\\% under sharding techniques.\n }\n{\\color{black}\nSharding has been proposed to mainly improve the scalability and the throughput performance of blockchains. A good sharding policy should minimize the cross-shard communications as much as possible. A classic design of sharding is the \\textit{Transactions Sharding}. However, such Transactions Sharding exploits the \\textit{random sharding} policy, which leads to a dilemma that most transactions are cross-shard. To this end, Nguyen \\textit{et al.}  proposed a new sharding paradigm differing from the random sharding, called OptChain, which can minimize the number of cross-shard transactions. The authors achieved their goal through the following two aspects. First they designed two metrics, named  T2S-score (Transaction-to-Shard) and L2S-score (Latency-to-Shard), respectively. T2S-score aims to measure how likely a transaction should be placed into a shard, while L2S-score is used to measure the confirmation latency when placing a transaction into a shard. Next, they utilized a well-known PageRank analysis to calculate T2S-score and proposed a mathematical model to estimate L2S-score. Finally, how does the proposed OptChain place transactions into shards based on the combination of T2S and L2S scores? In brief, they introduced another metric composed of both T2S and L2S, called  \\textit{temporal fitness} score. For a given transaction $u$ and a shard $S_i$, OptChain figures the temporal fitness score for the pair $\\langle u, S_i \\rangle$. Then, OptChain just puts transaction $u$ into the shard that is with the highest temporal fitness score.\n Similar to , Dang \\textit{et al.}  proposed a new shard-formation protocol, in which the nodes of different shards are re-assigned into different committees to reach a certain safety degree. In addition, they also proposed a coordination protocol to handle the cross-shard transactions towards guarding against the Byzantine-fault malicious coordinators. The experiment results showed that the throughput achieves a few thousands of TPS in both a local cluster with 100 nodes and a large-scale Google cloud platform testbed.\n Considering that the reshuffling operations lead to huge data migration in the sharding-based protocols, Chen \\textit{et al.}  devised a non-reshuffling structure called SSChain. Such new sharding-based protocol can avoid the overhead of data migration while enabling both transaction sharding and state sharding. Their evaluation results showed that SSChain achieves at least 6500 TPS in a network with 1800 nodes and no periodical data-migration needed.\n  Multiple chains can help increase the throughput of the blockchain. However, one issue under multiple-chain system must be solved. That is, the logical ordering of blocks generated should be guaranteed, because the correct logical order is critical to the confirmation of transactions. To this end, Niu \\textit{et al.}  proposed Eumonia, which is a permissionless parallel-chain protocol towards a global ordering of blocks. The authors implemented Eunomia by exploiting a fine-grained UTXO sharding model, in which the conflicted transactions can be well handled, and such protocol is proved as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) friendly.\n Although the sharding techniques have received much interests recently, it should be noticed that the committee organization is easily to attract Sybil attacks, in which a malicious node can compromise the consensus by creating multiple dummy committee members in the vote phase of the consensus protocol. To address such Sybil attacks, Rajab \\textit{et al.}  systematically formulated a model and performed an analysis w.r.t the vulnerability of Sybil attacks in the pioneer sharding protocol Elastico . The authors found that the blockchain nodes that have high hash-computing power are capable to manipulate Elastico protocol using a large number of Sybil IDs. The other two conditions of Sybil attacks were derived and evaluated by numerical simulations.\n The traditional Sharding blockchain protocols can only endure up to 1/3 Byzantine-fault nodes within a shard. This weak BFT feature makes the number of nodes inside a shard cannot be small to ensure the shard functions securely. To improve the sustainability of blockchain sharding, Xu \\textit{et al.}   proposed a new BFT sharding approach that can tolerate at most 1/2 Byzantine-fault nodes existing inside a shard. This approach benefits the throughput of decentralized databases.\n Although the existing sharding-based protocols, e.g., Elastico, OminiLedger and RapaidChain, have gained a lot of attention, they still have some drawbacks. For example, the mutual connections among all honest nodes require a big amount of communication resources. Furthermore, there is no an incentive mechanism driven nodes to participate in sharding protocol actively. To solve those problems, Zhang \\textit{et al.}   proposed \\textit{CycLedger}, which is a protocol designed for the sharding-based distributed ledger towards scalability, reliable security, and incentives. Such the proposed CycLedger is able to select a leader and a subset of nodes for each committee that handle the intra-shard consensus and the synchronization with other committees. A semi-commitment strategy and a recovery processing scheme were also proposed to deal with system crashing. In addition, the authors also proposed a reputation-based incentive policy to encourage nodes behaving honestly. \n}", "cites": [2158, 2161, 2156, 7552, 2155, 2160, 8529], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5384615384615384, "origin_cites_number": 13, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.8}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple sharding protocols (Elastico, RapidChain, SharPer, OptChain, Dang et al., SSChain, Eunomia) and connects their design choices and challenges, such as cross-shard communication, data migration, and load balancing.

Such interoperability mainly includes  the effective communications and data exchange amongst multiple blockchains, as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:interoperabilityMap}. A lot of theoretical and practical issues of this direction need urgent solutions. Some representative studies are reviewed as follows.\n To enable rich functionalities and capabilities for the future blockchain ecosystems, Jin \\textit{et al.}  proposed a novel interoperability architecture that supports the cross-chain cooperation among multiple blockchains, such as bitcoin and Ethereum. The authors classified the interoperability of multiple-chain ecosystems into passive and active modes, which are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:interoperability}. Then, the authors introduced a particular method, called Monitor Multiplexing Reading (MMR), dedicated to the passive cross-chain communications. \n  Following the widespread adoption of smart contracts, the roles of blockchains have been upgraded from token exchanges into programmable state machines. Thus, the blockchain interoperability must evolve accordingly. To help realize such new type of interoperability among multiple heterogeneous blockchains, Liu \\textit{et al.} proposed HyperService, which includes two major components, i.e., a programming framework allowing developers to create cross-chain applications; and a universal interoperability protocol towards secure implementation of DApps on blockchains. The authors implemented a 35,000-line prototype to prove the practicality of HyperService. Using the prototype, the end-to-end delays of cross-chain DApps, and the aggregated platform throughput can be measured conveniently.\nIn an ecosystem that consists of multiple blockchains, interoperability among those difference blockchains is an essential issue. To help the smart-contract developers build DApps, Fynn \\textit{et al.}  proposed a practical \\textit{Move} protocol that works for multiple blockchains. The basic idea of such protocol is to support a move operation enabling to move objects and smart contracts from one blockchain to another.\nRecently, to enable cross-cryptocurrency transactions, Tian \\textit{et al.}  proposed a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange strategy implemented on Ethereum through smart contracts.\n  Additionally, a great number of studies of cross-chain communications are included in ,  in which readers can find a systematic classification of cross-chain communication protocols.\n }", "cites": [7551, 2163, 2162], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic synthesis of the cited papers by grouping them under the theme of blockchain interoperability and briefly describing their contributions.

Mutual communications are achieved by gossip-like P2P messages. Based on such P2P gossip communications,  Buchman \\textit{et al.}  proposed a new protocol named Tendermint, which serves as a new termination mechanism for simplifying BFT consensus protocol.\n In Monoxide proposed by , the authors have devised a novel proof-of-work scheme, named \\textit{Chu-ko-nu mining}. This new proof protocol encourages a miner to create multiple blocks in different zones simultaneously with a single PoW solving effort. This mechanism makes the effective mining power in each zone is almost equal to the level of the total physical mining power in the entire network. Thus, Chu-ko-nu mining increases the attack threshold for each zone to 50\\%. Furthermore, Chu-ko-nu mining can improve the energy consumption spent on mining new blocks because a lot of more blocks can be produced in each round of normal PoW mining.\n The online services of crowdsourcing face a challenge to find a suitable consensus protocol. By leveraging the advantages of the blockchain such as the traceability of service contracts, Zou \\textit{et al.}  proposed a new consensus protocol, named \\textit{Proof-of-Trust} (PoT) consensus, for crowdsourcing and the general online service industries. Basically, such PoT consensus protocol leverages a trust management of all service participants, and it works as a hybrid blockchain architecture in which a consortium blockchain integrates with a public service network.\n  }\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\caption{New Protocols \\& Infrastructures to Improving the Performance of Blockchains.}\n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{0.1\\textwidth}|p{0.03\\textwidth}|p{0.14\\textwidth}|p{0.6\\textwidth}|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Emphasis} &\\textbf{Ref.} &\\textbf{Recognition} &\\textbf{Methodology}\\\\\n\\hline\n\t\\multirow{6}*{New  Protocols}\n\t&      & Ouroboros Praos & Authors proposed a new secure Proof-of-stake protocol named \\textit{Ouroboros Praos}, which is proved secure in the semi-synchronous adversarial setting.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n\t{ } &    & Tendermint & Authors proposed a new BFT consensus protocol for the wide area network organized by the gossip-based P2P network under adversarial conditions.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n\t{ } &    & Chu-ko-nu mining & Authors proposed a novel proof-of-work scheme, named \\textit{Chu-ko-nu mining}, which incentivizes miners to create multiple blocks in different zones with only a single PoW mining.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n\t{ } &    & Proof-of-Trust (PoT)  & Authors proposed a novel Proof-of-Trust consensus for the online services of crowdsourcing.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t\\multirow{10}*{New} \n\t&  & StreamChain  & Authors proposed to shift the block-based distributed ledgers to a new paradigm of \\textit{stream transaction processing} to achieve a low end-to-end latencies without much affecting throughput.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n\t\\multirow{6}*{Infrastructures }\n\t&   & CAPER: Cross-App Trans. handling  & Authors proposed a permissioned blockchain named CAPER that can well manage both the internal and the cross-application transactions for distributed applications.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n\t\\multirow{4}*{\\& Architectures} \n\t&    & Optimal mining for miners  & Authors proposed an edge computing-based blockchain network architecture, aiming to allocate optimal computational resources for miners.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n\t{ } &    & AxeChain: Useful Mining  & Authors proposed a new framework for practical PoW blockchains called AxeChain, which can spend computing power of blockchains to solve arbitrary practical problems submitted by system clients.\\\\\n\t \\cline{2-4}\n\t{ } &     & Non-linear blockchain system  & Authors explored three major metrics of blockchains, and devised a non-linear blockchain system.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{Table:newProto}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [2165, 2164], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2222222222222222, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive summary of various new blockchain protocols and infrastructures, with minimal synthesis beyond listing their features.

However, the benefits of blocks are saturated in today's permissioned blockchains since the block-processing introduces large batching latencies. To the distributed ledgers that are neither geo-distributed nor Pow-required, Istv{\\'a}n \\textit{et al.}    proposed to shift the traditional block-based data structure into the paradigm of \\textit{stream-like transaction processing}. The premier advantage of such paradigm shift is to largely shrink the end-to-end latencies for permissioned blockchains. The authors developed a prototype of their concept based on Hyperledger Fabric. The results showed that the end-to-end latencies achieved sub-10 ms and the throughput was close to 1500 TPS.\n Permissioned blockchains have a number of limitations, such as poor performance, privacy leaking, and inefficient cross-application transaction handling mechanism. To address those issues, Amiri \\textit{et al.}  proposed CAPER, which a permissioned blockchain that can well deal with the cross-application transactions for distributed applications. In particular, CAPER constructs its blockchain ledger using DAG and handles the cross-application transactions by adopting three specific consensus protocols, i.e., a global consensus using a separate set of orders, a hierarchical consensus protocol, and a \\textit{one-level} consensus protocol.\n  Then, Chang \\textit{et al.}  proposed an edge computing-based blockchain  architecture, in which edge-computing providers supply computational resources for blockchain miners. The authors then formulated a two-phase stackelberg game for the proposed architecture, aiming to find the Stackelberg equilibrium of the theoretical optimal mining scheme.\n  Next, Zheng \\textit{et al.}  proposed a new infrastructure for practical PoW blockchains called AxeChain, which aims to exploit the precious computing power of miners to solve arbitrary practical problems submitted by system users. The authors also analyzed the trade-off between energy consumption and security guarantees of such AxeChain. This study opens up a new direction for pursing high energy efficiency of meaningful PoW protocols.\n With the non-linear (e.g., graphical) structure adopted by blockchain networks, researchers are becoming interested in the performance improvement brought by new data structures. To find insights under such non-linear blockchain systems, Chen \\textit{et al.}  performed a systematic analysis by taking three critical metrics into account, i.e., \\textit{full verification}, \\textit{scalability}, and \\textit{finality-duration}. The authors revealed that it is impossible to achieve a blockchain that enables those three metrics at the same time. Any blockchain designers must consider the trade-off among such three properties.  \n }", "cites": [2165], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section integrates several papers discussing new blockchain infrastructures and architectures, connecting them through the theme of performance improvement.

For example, Merkel Tree has been adopted by Bitcoin, and several blockchain protocols, such as Ghost , Phantom , and Conflux , constructed their blocks using  the directed acyclic graph (DAG) technique.\n Different from those generalized graph structures, we review the most recent studies that exploit the graph theories for better understanding blockchains in this part.\n  Since the transactions in blockchains are easily structured into graphs, the graph theories and graph-based data mining techniques are viewed as good tools to discover the interesting findings beyond the graphs of blockchain networks. \n  Some representative recent studies are reviewed as follows. \nLeveraging the techniques of graph analysis, Chen \\textit{et al.}  characterized three major activities on Ethereum, i.e., money transfer, the creation of smart contracts, and the invocation of smart contracts. The major contribution of this paper is that it performed the first systematic investigation and proposed new approaches based on cross-graph analysis, which can address two security issues existing in Ethereum: attack forensics and anomaly detection.\nParticularly, w.r.t the graph theory, the authors mainly concentrated on the following two aspects:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n     \\item \\textit{Graph Construction}: They identified four types of transactions that are not related to money transfer, smart contract creation, or smart contract invocation.\n     \\item \\textit{Graph Analysis}: Then, they divided the remaining transactions into three groups according to the activities they triggered, i.e., money flow graph (MFG), smart contract creation graph (CCG) and contract invocation graph (CIG).\n \\end{enumerate}\n Via this manner, the authors delivered many useful insights of transactions that are helpful to address the security issues of Ethereum.\n Similarly, by processing Bitcoin transaction history, Akcora \\textit{et al.}  and Dixon \\textit{et al.}  modeled the transfer network into an extreme transaction  graph. Through the analysis of chainlet  activities   in the constructed graph, they proposed to use GARCH-based forecasting models to identify the financial risk of Bitcoin market for cryptocurrency users. \n An emerging research direction associated with blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is to understand the network dynamics behind graphs of those blockchains, such as the transaction graph. This is because people are wondering what the connection between the price of a cryptocurrency and the dynamics of the overlying transaction graph is. To answer such a question, Abay \\textit{et al.}   proposed Chainnet, which is a computationally lightweight method to learning the graph features of blockchains. The authors also disclosed several insightful findings. For example, it is the topological feature of transaction graph that impacts the prediction of Bitcoin price dynamics, rather than the degree distribution of the transaction graph.\n  Furthermore, utilizing the Mt. Gox transaction history, Chen \\textit{et al.}  also exploited the graph-based data-mining approach to dig the market manipulation of Bitcoin. The authors constructed three graphs, i.e., extreme high graph (EHG), extreme low graph (ELG), and normal graph (NMG), based on the initial processing of transaction dataset. Then, they discovered many correlations between market manipulation patterns and the price of Bitcoin.\n On the other direction, based on \\textit{address graphs}, Victor \\textit{et al.}  studied the ERC20 token networks through analyzing smart contracts of Ethereum blockchain.  Different from other graph-based approaches, the authors focused on their attention on the address graphs, i.e., token networks. With all network addresses, each token network is viewed as an overlay graph of the entire Ethereum network addresses. Similar to , the authors presented the relationship between transactions by exploiting graph-based analysis, in which the arrows can denote the invoking functions between transactions and smart contracts, and the token transfers between transactions as well. The findings presented by this study help us have a well understanding of token networks in terms of time-varying characteristics, such as the usage patterns of the blockchain system. An interesting finding is that around 90\\% of all transfers stem from the top 1000 token contracts. That is to say, only less than 10\\% of  token recipients have transferred their tokens. This finding is contrary to the viewpoint proposed by , where Somin \\textit{et al.} showed that the full transfers seem to obey a power-law distribution. However, the study   indicated that those transfers in token networks likely do not follow a power law. The authors attributed such the observations to the following three possible reasons: 1) most of the token users don't have incentives to transfer their tokens. Instead, they just simply hold tokens; 2) the majority of inactive tokens are treated as something like unwanted spam; 3) a small portion, i.e., approximately 8\\%, of users intended to sell their tokens to a market exchange.\n Recently, Zhao \\textit{et al.}  explored the account creation, account vote, money transfer and contract authorization activities of early-stage EOSIO transactions through graph-based metric analysis. Their study revealed abnormal transactions like voting gangs and frauds.\n }", "cites": [2167, 8530, 1302, 2168, 2166], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4166666666666667, "origin_cites_number": 12, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple graph-based studies effectively, showing how they contribute to understanding blockchain transactions and security.

Such delays increase the probability of forking and the vulnerability to malicious attacks. Thus, it is critical to know how would the network dynamics caused by the block propagation latencies and the fluctuation of hashing power of miners impact the blockchain performance such as block generation rate. To find the connection between those factors,  Papadis \\textit{et al.}  developed stochastic models to derive the blockchain evolution in a wide-area network. Their results showed us practical insights for the design issues of blockchains, for example, how to change the difficulty of mining in the PoW consensus while guaranteeing an expected block generation rate or an immunity level of adversarial attacks. The authors then performed analytical studies and simulations to evaluate the accuracy of their models. This stochastic analysis opens up a door for us to have a deeper understanding of dynamics in a blockchain network.\nTowards the stability and scalability of blockchain systems, Gopalan \\textit{et al.}  also proposed a stochastic model for a blockchain system. During their modeling, a structural asymptotic property called \\textit{one-endedness} was identified. The authors also proved that a blockchain system is one-ended if it is stochastically stable. The upper and lower bounds of the stability region were also studied. The authors found that the stability bounds are closely related to the conductance of the P2P blockchain network. Those findings are very insightful such that researchers can assess the scalability of blockchain systems deployed on large-scale P2P networks.\n Although Sharding protocol is viewed as a very promising solution to solving the scalability of blockchains and adopted by multiple well-known blockchains such as RapidChain , OmniLedger , and Monoxide , the failure probability for a committee under Sharding protocol is still unknown. To fill this gap, Hafid \\textit{et al.}  proposed a stochastic model to capture the security analysis under Sharding-based blockchains using a probabilistic approach. With the proposed mathematical model, the upper bound of the failure probability was derived for a committee. In particular, three probability inequalities were used in their model, i.e., Chebyshev, Hoeffding, and Chv{\\'a}tal. The authors claim that the proposed stochastic model can be used to analyze the security of any Sharding-based protocol.\n }\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\caption{Various Modelings, Techniques and Theories for Better Understanding Blockchains.}\n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{0.07\\textwidth}|p{0.11\\textwidth}|p{0.07\\textwidth}|p{0.21\\textwidth}|p{0.38\\textwidth}|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Category}&\\textbf{Emphasis} &\\textbf{Ref.} &\\textbf{Metrics} &\\textbf{Methodology \\& Implications}\\\\\n\\hline\n\t\\multirow{12}*{Graph-} \n\t& \\multirow{8}*{Transactions} &   &  Cross-graph analysis of Ethereum & Via graph analysis, authors extracted three major activities, i.e., money transfer, smart contracts creation, and  smart contracts invocation.\\\\\n\t\\cline{3-5}\n\t\\multirow{8}*{based} \n\t&\\multirow{4}*{mining}&  & Features of transaction graphs  & Proposed an extendable and computationally efficient method for graph representation learning on Blockchains.\\\\\n\t\\cline{3-5}\n\t\\multirow{6}*{Theories} \n\t&{}&  & Market manipulation\npatterns  & Authors exploited the graph-based data-mining approach to reveal the market manipulation evidence of Bitcoin.\\\\\n\t\\cline{3-5}\n\t{ }&{}&   & Clustering coefficient, assortativity of TX graph & Authors exploited the graph-based analysis to reveal the abnormal transactions of EOSIO.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-5}\n\t{ }&\\multirow{5}*{Token networks}&  & Token-transfer distributions  & Authors studied the token networks through analyzing smart contracts of Ethereum blockchain based on graph analysis.\\\\\n\t\\cline{3-5}\n\t{ }&{}&  & Extreme chainlet activity & Authors proposed graph-based analysis models for assessing the financial investment risk of \\modified{Bitcoin}.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t\\multirow{12}*{Stochastic} \n\t & {Blockchain network analysis} &  & Block completion rates, and the probability of a successful adversarial attack  & Authors derived stochastic models to capture critical blockchain properties, and to evaluate the impact of blockchain propagation latency on key performance metrics.

Thus, a growing number of studies are exploiting the queueing theory to disclose the mining and consensus mechanisms of  blockchains. Some recent representative works are reviewed as follows.\n To develop a queueing theory of blockchain systems,  Li \\textit{et al.}  devised a batch-service queueing system to describe the mining and the creating of new blocks in miners' pool. For the blockchain queueing system, the authors exploited the type GI/M/1 continuous-time Markov process. Then, they derived the stable condition and the stationary probability matrix of the queueing system utilizing the matrix-geometric techniques.\n  Then, viewing that the confirmation delay of Bitcoin transactions are larger than conventional credit card systems, Ricci \\textit{et al.}  proposed a theoretical framework integrating the queueing theory and machine learning techniques to have a deep understanding towards the transaction confirmation time. The reason the authors chose the queueing theory for their study is that a queueing model is suitable to see insights into how the different blockchain parameters affect the transaction latencies. Their measurement results showed that the Bitcoin users experience a delay that is slightly larger than the residual time of a block confirmation.\n  Frolkova \\textit{et al.}  formulated the synchronization process of Bitcoin network as an infinite-server model. The authors derived a closed-form for the model that can be used to capture the queue stationary distribution. Furthermore, they also proposed a random-style fluid limit under service latencies.\n  On the other hand, to evaluate and optimize the performance of blockchain-based systems,  Memon  \\textit{et al.}  proposed a simulation model by exploiting queueing theory. In the proposed model, the authors constructed an  M/M/1 queue for the memory pool, and an M/M/c queue for the mining pool, respectively. This model can capture multiple critical statistics metrics of blockchain networks, such as the number of transactions every new block, the mining interval of a block, transactions throughput, and the waiting time in memory pool, etc.\n  Next, Fang \\textit{et al.}  proposed a queueing analytical model to allocate mining resources for the general PoW-based blockchain networks. The authors formulated the queueing model using Lyapunov optimization techniques.

To help analyze whether blockchain is appropriate to a specific application scenario, Wust \\textit{et al.}   provided the first structured analytical methodology and applied it to analyzing three representative scenarios, i.e., supply chain management, interbank payments, and decentralized autonomous organizations.\n \\modified{The other article  proposes a novel upper bound privacy leakage based approach to identify intermediate data sets partitioned and distributed in cloud for encryption. This approach can significantly improve the scalability and efficiency of data processing for privacy preserving in cloud. This study provides insights of scalability, efficiency and privacy issues in cloud for blockchain.}\n Although Ethereum has gained much popularity since its debut in 2014, the systematically analysis of Ethereum transactions still suffers from insufficient explorations. Therefore, Lin \\textit{et al.}  proposed to model the transactions using the techniques of multiplex network. The authors then devised several random-walk strategies for graph representation of the transactions network. This study could help us better understand the temporal data and the multiplicity features of Ethereum transactions.\nTo better understand the network features of an Ethereum transaction, Sousa \\textit{et al.}  focused on the pending time, which is defined as the latency counting from the time a transaction is observed to the time this transaction is packed into the blockchain. The authors tried to find the correlations between such pending time with the fee-related parameters such as gas and gas price. Surprisingly, their data-driven empirical analysis results showed that the correlation between those two factors has no clear clue. This finding is counterintuitive.\n To achieve a consensus about the state of blockchains, miners have to compete with each other by invoking a certain proof mechanism, say PoW. Such competition among miners is the key module to public blockchains such as Bitcoin. \n To model the competition over multiple miners of a cryptocurrency blockchain,\nAltman \\textit{et al.}   exploited the Game Theory to find a Nash equilibria while peers are competing mining resources. The proposed approach help researchers well understand such competition. However, the authors also mentioned that they didn't study the punishment and cooperation between miners over the repeated games. Those open topics will be very interesting for future studies.\n\\modified{\n Besides competitions among individual miners, there are also competitions among mining pools. Malicious pools can pull off DDoS attacks to overload the victim pools' manager with invalid share submissions. The delay in verifying extra share submissions potentially impairs the hash power of the victim pool and thus undermines the potential reward for pool miners. Knowing that the chance of getting a reward is smaller, miners in the victim pools would migrate to another mining pools, which would further weaken the victim pools. To better understand this kind of competition, Wu \\textit{et al.}  proposed a stochastic game-theoretic model in a two-mining-pool case. The authors used Q-learning algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium and maximize the long-term payoffs. The experiment showed that the smaller mining pool is more likely to attack the larger one. Also, mining pools tend to adopt lower attack level when the DDoS attack cost increases.\n}\n To ensure the consistency of PoW blockchain in an asynchronous network,  Zhao \\textit{et al.}  performed an analysis and derived a neat bound  around $\\frac{2\\mu}{\\ln (\\mu/\\nu)}$, where $\\mu + \\nu = 1$, with $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ denoting the fraction of computation power dominated by the honest and adversarial miners, respectively. Such a neat bound of mining latencies is helpful to us to well understand the consistency of Nakamoto's blockchain consensus in asynchronous networks. \n  Bitcoin's consensus security is built upon the assumption of honest-majority. Under this assumption, the blockchain system is thought secure only if the majority of miners are honest while voting towards a global consensus. Recent researches believe that network connectivity, the forks of a blockchain, and the strategy of mining are major factors that impact the security of consensus in Bitcoin blockchain. To provide pioneering concrete modelings and analysis,  Xiao \\textit{et al.}  proposed an analytical model to evaluate the network connectivity on the consensus security of PoW blockchains.\nTo validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model, the authors applied it to two adversary scenarios, i.e., \\textit{honest-but-potentially-colluding}, and \\textit{selfish mining} models.\n Although Sharding is viewed as a prevalent technique for improving the scalability to blockchain systems, several essential questions are: what we can expect from and what price is required to pay for introducing Sharding technique to Ethereum? To answer those questions, Fynn \\textit{et al.}  studied how sharding works for Ethereum by modeling Ethereum into a graph. Via partitioning the graph, they evaluated the trade-off between the edge-cut and balance. Several practical insights have been disclosed. For example, three major components, e..g, computation, storage and bandwidth, are playing a critical role when partitioning Ethereum; A good design of incentives is also necessary for adopting sharding mechanism.\n As mentioned multiple times, sharding technique is viewed as a promising solution to improving the scalability of blockchains. However, the properties of a sharded blockchain under a fully adaptive adversary are still unknown. To this end, Avarikioti \\textit{et al.}   defined the \\textit{consistency} and \\textit{scalability} for sharded blockchain protocol. The limitations of security and efficiency of sharding protocols were also derived. Then, they analyzed these two properties on the context of multiple popular sharding-based protocols such as  \\textit{OmniLedger},  \\textit{RapidChain},  \\textit{Elastico}, and  \\textit{Monoxide}. Several interesting conclusions have been drawn. For example,  the authors thought that Elastico and Momoxide failed to guarantee the balance between consistency and scalability properties, while OmniLedger and RapidChain fulfill all requirements of a robust sharded blockchain protocol. \n Forking attacks has become the normal threats faced by the blockchain market. The related existing studies mainly focus on the detection of such attacks through transactions. However, this manner cannot prevent the forking attacks from happening. To resist the forking attacks, Wang \\textit{et al.}  studied the fine-grained vulnerability of blockchain networks caused by intentional forks using the large deviation theory. This study can help set the robustness parameters for a blockchain network since the vulnerability analysis provides the correlation between robust level and the vulnerability probability. In detail, the authors found that it is much more cost-efficient to set the robust level parameters than to spend the computational capability used to lower the attack probability.\n The existing economic analysis  reported that the attacks towards PoW mining-based blockchain systems can be cheap under a specific condition when renting sufficient hashrate capability. Moroz \\textit{et al.}  studied how to defense the double-spend attacks in an interesting reverse direction. The authors found that the counterattack of victims can lead to a classic game-theoretic \\textit{War of Attrition} model. This study showed us the double-spend attacks on some PoW-based blockchains are actually cheap. However, the defense or even counterattack to such double-spend attacks is possible when victims  are owning the same capacity as the attacker.\n Although BFT protocols have attracted a lot of attention, there are still a number of fundamental limitations unaddressed while running blockchain applications based on the classical BFT protocols. Those limitations include one related to low performance issues, and two correlated to the gaps between the state machine replication and blockchain models (i.e., the lack of strong persistence guarantees and the occurrence of forks).  To identify those limitations, Bessani \\textit{et al.}   first studied them using a digital coin blockchain App called SmartCoin, and a popular BFT replication library called BFT-SMART, then they discussed how to tackle these limitations in a protocol-agnostic manner. The authors also implemented an experimental platform of permissioned blockchain, namely SmartChain. Their evaluation results showed that SmartChain can address the limitations aforementioned and significantly improve the performance of a blockchain application. \n {\\color{blue}\n The Nakamoto protocol is designed to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem for permissionless Blockchains. However, a general analytical model is still missing for capturing the steady-state profit of each miner against the competitors.\n To this end, Yu \\textit{et al.}  studied the weighted resource distribution of proof-based consensus engines, referred to as Proof-of-X (PoX), in large-scale networks. The proposed Markov model attempts to unify the analysis of different PoX mechanisms considering three new unified metrics, i.e., resource sensitivity, system convergence, and resource fairness. }\n }\n\\begin{table*}[h!t]\n\\caption{Data Analytics for Better Understanding Cryptocurrency Blockchains.}\n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{0.14\\textwidth}|p{0.05\\textwidth}|p{0.19\\textwidth}|p{0.5\\textwidth}|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Emphasis} &\\textbf{Ref.} &\\textbf{Metrics} &\\textbf{Methodology \\& Implications}\\\\\n\\hline\n  \t\\multirow{3}*{Cryptojacking}\n\t &   \\multirow{2}*{}  &  Hardware performance counters & Authors proposed a machine learning-based solution to prevent cryptojacking attacks.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n  \t\\multirow{1}*{detection}\n\t&  \\multirow{2}*{}  &  Various system resource utilization & Authors proposed an in-browser cryptojacking detection approach (CapJack), based on the latest CapsNet.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\tMarket-manipulation mining &   \\multirow{2}*{ } &  Various graph characteristics of transaction graph & Authors proposed a mining approach using the exchanges collected from the transaction networks.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\tPredicting volatility of Bitcoin price &   \\multirow{2}*{ }  &  Various graph characteristics of extreme chainlets & Authors proposed a graph-based analytic model to predict the intraday financial risk of Bitcoin market.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\tMoney-laundering detection &    \\multirow{2}*{}  &  Various graph characteristics of transaction graph & Authors exploited machine learning models to detect potential money laundering activities from Bitcoin transactions.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t\\multirow{3}*{Ponzi-scheme} &     \\multirow{2}*{}  &   Factors that affect scam persistence & Authors analyzed the demand and supply perspectives of Ponzi schemes on Bitcoin ecosystem.\\\\\n\t\\cline{2-4}\n\t\\multirow{1}*{detection} \n\t&    &  Account and code features of smart contracts & Authors detected Ponzi schemes for Ethereum based on data mining and machine learning approaches.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\tDesign problem of cryptoeconomic systems &    \\multirow{3}*{} &  Price of XNS token, Subsidy of App developers  & Authors presented a practical evidence-based example to show how data science and stochastic modeling can be applied to designing cryptoeconomic blockchains.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\tPricing mining hardware &  \\multirow{2}*{} &   \\multirow{2}*{Miner revenue,  ASIC value}  & Authors studied the correlation between the price of mining hardware (ASIC) and the value volatility of underlying cryptocurrency.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{Table:analyticsCrptocurrency}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [2167, 7550, 2173, 2172, 8533, 2174, 7555, 2171, 7554, 8532], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4, "origin_cites_number": 25, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by grouping related works on analytical modeling and game-theoretic analysis of blockchain systems.

The  performance evaluated includes the distribution of block propagation delays, the relationship between block size and mining rate, block size versus assembly time, the expected time to reach consensus on block hash, the expected time to reach consensus on blocks, etc. \n Later, Zheng \\textit{et al.}  proposed a scalable framework for monitoring the real-time performance blockchain systems. This work has evaluated four popular blockchain systems, i.e., Ethereum, Parity , Cryptape Inter-enterprise Trust Automation (CITA)  and Hyperledger Fabric , in terms of several metrics including \\textit{transactions per second}, \\textit{average response delay}, \\textit{transactions per CPU}, \\textit{transactions per memory second}, \\textit{transactions per disk I/O} and \\textit{transactions per network data}.\n Such comprehensive performance evaluation results offered us rich viewpoints on the 4 popular blockchain systems.\n Their experimental logs and technique report  can be accessed from \\url{http://xblock.pro}. \n Recently, Zheng \\textit{et al.}  extended their work and released a new open-source dataset framework, called XBlock-ETH, for the data-driven analysis of Ethereum. XBlock-ETH contains multiple types of Ethereum data such as transactions, smart contracts and tokens. Thus, researchers can extract and explore the data of Ethereum using XBlock-ETH. The authors first collected and cleaned the most recent on-chain dataset from Ethereum. Then, they presented how to perform basic exploration of these datasets to make them best. Like their previous work, those datasets and processing codes can be found from the webpage \\textit{xblock.pro} aforementioned.\n In the other similar work  of the same team, authors proposed another new dataset framework dedicated to EOSIO, named XBlock-EOS, which also includes multiple types of rich on-chain/off-chain datasets such as transactions, blocks, smart contracts, internal/external EOS transfer events, tokens, accounts and resource management. To show how to utilize the proposed framework, the authors presented comprehensive statistics and explorations using those datasets, for example, blockchain analysis, smart contract analysis, and cryptocurrency analysis. Finally, this study also discussed future directions of XBlock-EOS in the topics including: i) data analysis based on off-chain data to provide off-chain user behavior for blockchain developers, ii) exploring new features of EOSIO data that are different from those of Ethereum, and iii) conducting a joint analysis of EOSIO with other blockchains.\n }\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\caption{Blockchain Dataset Frameworks and Evaluation Tools.}\n\\centering\n\\footnotesize\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{0.15\\textwidth}|p{0.1\\textwidth}|p{0.03\\textwidth}|p{0.58\\textwidth}|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Recognition}&\\textbf{Target} &\\textbf{Ref.} &\\textbf{Utilization}\\\\\n\\hline\n\t\\multirow{3}*{XBlock-ETH} & \\multirow{3}*{Ethereum} &  \\multirow{3}*{} &  Authors released a new open-source dataset framework for analysis of Ethereum, i.e., XBlock-ETH, which includes multiple types of Ethereum datasets such as transactions, smart contracts and tokens. \\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t\\multirow{2}*{XBlock-EOS}  & \\multirow{2}*{EOS} &  \\multirow{2}*{} & Authors proposed a new dataset framework dedicated to EOSIO, named XBlock-EOS, to show how to perform comprehensive statistics and exploration of EOSIO datasets.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t\\multirow{2}*{BlockSci}   &  {General blockchains}  &  \\multirow{2}*{} & Authors proposed an open-source software platform, named BlockSci, for the analysis of blockchains.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t\\multirow{2}*{Blockbench}   & General blockchains &  \\multirow{2}*{}  & Authors proposed a benchmarking framework for measuring the data processing capability and performance of different layers of a blockchain system.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t\\multirow{2}*{NodeFinder}   & Etheruem nodes &  \\multirow{2}*{}  & Authors proposed a measuring tool named NodeFinder, to investigate the opaque network characteristics of Ethereum network nodes.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\tNetwork simulator for Bitcoin  & \\multirow{2}*{Bitcoin} & \\multirow{2}*{}  & Authors proposed a configurable network simulator for the performance measurements of Bitcoin using lightweight virtualization technologies.\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{Table:datasetFramework}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [1292, 2177, 7556, 2178, 2179], "cite_extract_rate": 0.3125, "origin_cites_number": 16, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section primarily serves as a descriptive summary of various performance measurement tools, datasets, and methodologies from multiple studies.

Under the architecture of BlockSci, the raw blockchain data is parsed to produce the core blockchain data including transaction graph, indexes and scripts, which are then provided to the analysis library. Together with the auxiliary data including P2P data, price data and user tags, a client can either directly query or read through a Jupyter notebook interface.\n  To evaluate the performance of private blockchains, Dinh \\textit{et al.}  proposed a benchmarking framework, named Blockbench, which can measure the data processing capability and the performance of various layers of a blockchain system. Using such Blockbench, the authors then performed detailed measurements and analysis of three blockchains, i.e., Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger. The results disclosed some useful experiences of those three blockchain systems. For example, today's blockchains are not scalable w.r.t data processing workloads, and several bottlenecks should be considered while designing different layers of blockchain in the software engineering perspective.\n  Ethereum has received enormous attention on the mining challenges, the analytics of smart contracts, and the management of block mining. However, not so many efforts have been spent on the information dissemination in the perspective of P2P networks. To fill this gap, Kim \\textit{et al.}  proposed a measuring tool named NodeFinder, which aims to discover the opaque network properties of Ethereum network nodes. Through a three-month long data collection on the P2P network, the authors analyzed and found several unprecedented differences of Ethereum network comparing with other popular P2P networks like BitTorrent, Bitcoin and Gnutella in terms of network size and geographic distribution.\n Recently, by exploiting lightweight virtualization technologies,  Alsahan \\textit{et al.}  developed a configurable network simulator for the performance measurements of Bitcoin. The proposed simulator allows users to configure diverse network conditions, such as blockchain network topology, link delays, and mining difficulties, to emulate the real-world operation environment. Using this simulator, experiments can be performed to measure Bitcoin network under various network conditions. It also supports conducting the tests of security attacks and point of failure simulations. The authors also made this simulator open-source on Github.\n }", "cites": [2177, 7556, 2179], "cite_extract_rate": 0.75, "origin_cites_number": 4, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic description of the tools proposed in the cited papers but does not deeply synthesize or integrate the findings into a broader framework.
