upsampling in an end-to-end manner, transposed convolution layer and sub-pixel layer are introduced into the SR field.\n\\textbf{Transposed Convolution Layer.}\nTransposed convolution layer, a.k.a. deconvolution layer , tries to perform transformation opposite a normal convolution, i.e., predicting the possible input based on feature maps sized like convolution output.\nSpecifically, it increases the image resolution by expanding the image by inserting zeros and performing convolution.\nTaking $2\\times$ SR with $3 \\times 3$ kernel as example (as Fig. \\ref{fig_deconv} shows), the input is firstly expanded twice of the original size, where the added pixel values are set to $0$ (Fig. \\ref{fig_deconv_1}).\nThen a convolution with kernel sized $3 \\times 3$, stride $1$ and padding $1$ is applied (Fig. \\ref{fig_deconv_2}).\nIn this way, the input is upsampled by a factor of 2, in which case the receptive field is at most $2 \\times 2$.\nSince the transposed convolution enlarges the image size in an end-to-end manner while maintaining a connectivity pattern compatible with vanilla convolution, it is widely used as upsampling layers in SR models .\nHowever, this layer can easily cause ``uneven overlapping'' on each axis , and the multiplied results on both axes further create a checkerboard-like pattern of varying magnitudes and thus hurt the SR performance.\n\\textbf{Sub-pixel Layer.}\nThe sub-pixel layer , another end-to-end learnable upsampling layer, performs upsampling by generating a plurality of channels by convolution and then reshaping them, as Fig. \\ref{fig_sub_pixel} shows.\nWithin this layer, a convolution is firstly applied for producing outputs with $s^2$ times channels, where $s$ is the scaling factor (Fig. \\ref{fig_sub_pixel_1}).\nAssuming the input size is $h \\times w \\times c$, the output size will be $h \\times w \\times s^2 c$.\nAfter that, the reshaping operation (a.k.a. \\textit{shuffle} ) is performed to produce outputs with size $sh \\times sw \\times c$ (Fig. \\ref{fig_sub_pixel_2}).\nIn this case, the receptive field can be up to $3 \\times 3$.\nDue to the end-to-end upsampling manner, this layer is also widely used by SR models .\nCompared with transposed convolution layer, the sub-pixel layer has a larger receptive field, which provides more contextual information to help generate more realistic details.\nHowever, since the distribution of the receptive fields is uneven and blocky regions actually share the same receptive field, it may result in some artifacts near the boundaries of different blocks.\nOn the other hand, independently predicting adjacent pixels in a blocky region may cause unsmooth outputs.\nThus Gao \\textit{et al.}  propose PixelTCL, which replaces the independent prediction to interdependent sequential prediction, and produces smoother and more consistent results.\n\\textbf{Meta Upscale Module.}\n The previous methods need to predefine the scaling factors, i.e., training different upsampling modules for different factors, which is inefficient and not in line with real needs.\nSo that Hu \\textit{et al.}  propose meta upscale module (as Fig. \\ref{fig_meta_upscale} shows), which firstly solves SR of arbitrary scaling factors based on meta learning.\nSpecifically, for each target position on the HR images, this module project it to a small patch on the LR feature maps (i.e., $k \\times k \\times c_{in}$), predicts convolution weights (i.e., $k \\times k \\times c_{in} \\times c_{out}$) according to the projection offsets and the scaling factor by dense layers and perform convolution.\nIn this way, the meta upscale module can continuously zoom in it with arbitrary factors by a single model.\nAnd due to the large amount of training data (multiple factors are simultaneously trained), the module can exhibit comparable or even better performance on fixed factors.\nAlthough this module needs to predict weights during inference, the execution time of the upsampling module only accounts for about 1\\% of the time of feature extraction .\nHowever, this method predicts a large number of convolution weights for each target pixel based on several values independent of the image contents, so the prediction result may be unstable and less efficient when faced with larger magnifications.\nNowadays, these learning-based layers have become the most widely used upsampling methods.\nEspecially in the post-upsampling framework (Sec. \\ref{sec_framework_post}), these layers are usually used in the final upsampling phase for reconstructing HR images based on high-level representations extracted in low-dimensional space, and thus achieve end-to-end SR while avoiding overwhelming operations in high-dimensional space.", "cites": [499, 7034, 484, 7257, 481, 7255, 496], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0,

\\phi, l) = \\frac{1}{h_l w_l c_l} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i,j,k} (\\phi^{(l)}_{i,j,k}(\\hat{I}) - \\phi^{(l)}_{i,j,k}(I))^2} ,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $h_l$, $w_l$ and $c_l$ are the height, width and number of channels of the representations on layer $l$, respectively.\nEssentially the content loss transfers the learned knowledge of hierarchical image features from the classification network $\\phi$ to the SR network.\nIn contrast to the pixel loss, the content loss encourages the output image $\\hat{I}$ to be perceptually similar to the target image $I$ instead of forcing them to match pixels exactly.\nThus it produces visually more perceptible results and is also widely used in this field , where the VGG  and ResNet  are the most commonly used pre-trained CNNs.\n\\textbf{Texture Loss.}\nOn account that the reconstructed image should have the same style (e.g., colors, textures, contrast) with the target image, and motivated by the style representation by Gatys \\textit{et al.} , the texture loss (a.k.a style reconstruction loss) is introduced into SR.\nFollowing , the image texture is regarded as the correlations between different feature channels and defined as the Gram matrix $G^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c_l \\times c_l}$, where $G^{(l)}_{ij}$ is the inner product between the vectorized feature maps $i$ and $j$ on layer $l$:\n\\begin{equation}\n    G^{(l)}_{ij}(I) = \\operatorname{vec}(\\phi_i^{(l)}(I)) \\cdot \\operatorname{vec}(\\phi_j^{(l)}(I)) ,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\operatorname{vec}(\\cdot)$ denotes the vectorization operation, and $\\phi_i^{(l)}(I)$ denotes the $i$-th channel of the feature maps on layer $l$ of image $I$.\nThen the texture loss is given by:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{texture}} (\\hat{I}, I ; \\phi, l) = \\frac{1}{c_l^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i,j} (G^{(l)}_{i,j}(\\hat{I}) - G^{(l)}_{i,j}(I))^2} .\n\\end{equation}\nBy employing texture loss, the EnhanceNet  proposed by Sajjadi \\textit{et al.} creates much more realistic textures and produces visually more satisfactory results.\nDespite this, determining the patch size to match textures is still empirical.\nToo small patches lead to artifacts in textured regions, while too large patches lead to artifacts throughout the entire image because texture statistics are averaged over regions of varying textures.\n\\textbf{Adversarial Loss.}\nIn recent years, due to the powerful learning ability, the GANs  receive more and more attention and are introduced to various vision tasks.\nTo be concrete, the GAN consists of a generator performing generation (e.g., text generation, image transformation), and a discriminator which takes the generated results and instances sampled from the target distribution as input and discriminates whether each input comes from the target distribution.\nDuring training, two steps are alternately performed:\n(a) fix the generator and train the discriminator to better discriminate,\n(b) fix the discriminator and train the generator to fool the discriminator.\nThrough adequate iterative adversarial training, the resulting generator can produce outputs consistent with the distribution of real data, while the discriminator can't distinguish between the generated data and real data.\nIn terms of super-resolution, it is straightforward to adopt adversarial learning, in which case we only need to treat the SR model as a generator, and define an extra discriminator to judge whether the input image is generated or not.\nTherefore, Ledig \\textit{et al.}  firstly propose SRGAN using adversarial loss based on cross entropy, as follows:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gan\\_ce\\_g}} (\\hat{I} ; D) &= - \\log D(\\hat{I}) , \\\\\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gan\\_ce\\_d}} (\\hat{I}, I_s ; D) &= - \\log D(I_s) - \\log (1 - D(\\hat{I})) ,\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gan\\_ce\\_g}}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gan\\_ce\\_d}}$ denote the adversarial loss of the generator (i.e., the SR model) and the discriminator $D$ (i.e., a binary classifier), respectively, and $I_s$ represents images randomly sampled from the ground truths.\nBesides, the Enhancenet  also adopts the similar adversarial loss.\nBesides, Wang \\textit{et al.}  and Yuan \\textit{et al.}  use adversarial loss based on least square error for more stable training process and higher quality results , given by:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gan\\_ls\\_g}} (\\hat{I} ; D) &= (D(\\hat{I}) - 1)^2 , \\\\\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gan\\_ls\\_d}} (\\hat{I}, I_s ; D) &= (D(\\hat{I}))^2 + (D(I_s) - 1)^2 .\n\\end{align}\nIn contrast to the above works focusing on the specific forms of adversarial loss, Park \\textit{et al.}  argue that the pixel-level discriminator causes generating meaningless high-frequency noise, and attach another feature-level discriminator to operate on high-level representations extracted by a pre-trained CNN which captures more meaningful attributes of real HR images.  \nXu \\textit{et al.}  incorporate a multi-class GAN consisting of a generator and multiple class-specific discriminators.\nAnd the ESRGAN  employs relativistic GAN  to predict the probability that real images are relatively more realistic than fake ones, instead of the probability that input images are real or fake, and thus guide recovering more detailed textures.\nExtensive MOS tests (Sec. \\ref{sec_iqa_mos}) show that even though the SR models trained with adversarial loss and content loss achieve lower PSNR compared to those trained with pixel loss, they bring significant gains in perceptual quality .\nAs a matter of fact, the discriminator extracts some difficult-to-learn latent patterns of real HR images, and pushes the generated HR images to conform, thus helps to generate more realistic images.\nHowever, currently the training process of GAN is still difficult and unstable.\nAlthough there have been some studies on how to stabilize the GAN training , how to ensure that the GANs integrated into SR models are trained correctly and play an active role remains a problem.\n\\textbf{Cycle Consistency Loss.}\nMotivated by the CycleGAN proposed by Zhu \\textit{et al.} , Yuan \\textit{et al.}  present a cycle-in-cycle approach for super-resolution.  \nConcretely speaking, they not only super-resolve the LR image $I$ to the HR image $\\hat{I}$ but also downsample $\\hat{I}$ back to another LR image $I'$ through another CNN.\nThe regenerated $I'$ is required to be identical to the input $I$, thus the cycle consistency loss is introduced for constraining their pixel-level consistency:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cycle}} (I', I) = \\frac{1}{hwc} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i,j,k} (I'_{i,j,k} - I_{i,j,k})^2} .\n\\end{equation}\n\\textbf{Total Variation Loss.}\nIn order to suppress noise in generated images, the total variation (TV) loss  is introduced into SR by Aly \\textit{et al.} .\nIt is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between neighboring pixels and measures how much noise is in the images, as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{TV}} (\\hat{I}) = \\frac{1}{hwc} \\sum_{i,j,k} \\sqrt{\n        (\\hat{I}_{i,j+1,k} - \\hat{I}_{i,j,k})^2 +\n        (\\hat{I}_{i+1,j,k} - \\hat{I}_{i,j,k})^2} .\n\\end{equation}\nLai \\textit{et al.}  and Yuan \\textit{et al.}  also adopt the TV loss for imposing spatial smoothness.\n\\textbf{Prior-Based Loss.}\nIn addition to the above loss functions, external prior knowledge is also introduced to constrain the generation.\nSpecifically, Bulat \\textit{et al.}  focus on face image SR and introduce a face alignment network (FAN) to constrain the consistency of facial landmarks.  \nThe FAN is pre-trained and integrated for providing face alignment priors, and then trained jointly with the SR.\nIn this way, the proposed Super-FAN improves performance both on LR face alignment and face image SR.\nAs a matter of fact, the content loss and the texture loss, both of which introduce a classification network, essentially provide prior knowledge of hierarchical image features for SR.\nBy introducing more prior knowledge, the SR performance can be further improved.\nIn this section, we introduce various loss functions for SR.\nIn practice, researchers often combine multiple loss functions by weighted average  for constraining different aspects of the generation process, especially for distortion-perception tradeoff .\nHowever, the weights of different loss functions require a lot of empirical exploration, and how to combine reasonably and effectively remains a problem.", "cites": [8317, 516, 513, 515, 512, 121, 514, 480, 7258, 483, 97, 481, 482, 487, 7030, 63, 78, 7254, 511, 518, 7022, 517], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6285714285714286, "origin_cites_number": 35, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a coherent synthesis of different loss functions in deep learning-based SR, connecting pixel, content, texture, and adversarial losses across multiple works.
