They are increasingly used in high-stakes scenarios such as loans  and hiring decisions .\nThere are clear benefits to algorithmic decision-making; unlike people, machines do not become tired or bored~, and can take into account orders of magnitude more factors than people can. However, like people, algorithms are vulnerable to biases that render their decisions ``unfair''~.\nIn the context of decision-making, fairness is the \\textit{absence of any prejudice or favoritism toward an individual or group based on their inherent or acquired characteristics}. Thus, an unfair algorithm is one \nwhose decisions are skewed \ntoward a particular group of people. A canonical example comes \nfrom a tool \nused by courts in the United States to make pretrial detention and release decisions. The software, Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), measures the \nrisk of a person to recommit another crime. \nJudges use COMPAS to decide whether to release an offender, or to keep him or her in prison. \nAn investigation into the software found \na bias against \nAfrican-Americans:\\footnote{https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing}\nCOMPAS is more likely to \nhave higher false positive rates for African-American offenders than Caucasian offenders \nin falsely predicting them to be at a higher risk of recommitting a crime or recidivism.\nSimilar findings have been made in other areas, such as an AI system that judges beauty pageant winners but was biased against darker-skinned contestants,\\footnote{https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/artificial-intelligence-beauty-contest-doesnt-like-black-people} or facial recognition software in digital cameras that overpredicts Asians as blinking.\\footnote{http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1954643,00.html} These biased predictions stem from the hidden or neglected biases in data or algorithms.\nIn this survey we identify two potential sources of unfairness in machine learning outcomes---those that arise from biases in the data and those that arise from the algorithms. We review research investigating how biases in data skew what is learned by machine learning algorithms, and \nnuances in the way the algorithms themselves work to prevent them from making fair decisions---even when the data is unbiased. Furthermore, we observe that biased algorithmic outcomes might impact user experience, thus generating a feedback loop between data, algorithms and users that can perpetuate and even amplify existing sources of bias. \nWe begin the review with several highly visible real-world cases of where unfair machine learning algorithms have led to suboptimal and discriminatory outcomes in Section~\\ref{sec:examples}. In Section~\\ref{sec:loop}, we describe the different types and sources of biases that occur within the data-algorithms-users loop mentioned above. Next, in Section~\\ref{sec:alg-fairness}, we present the different ways that the concept of fairness has been operationalized and studied in the literature. We discuss the ways in which these two concepts are coupled. Last, we will focus on different families of machine learning approaches, how fairness manifests differently in each one, and the current state-of-the-art for tackling them in Section~\\ref{sec:methods}, followed by potential areas of future work in each of the domains in Section~\\ref{sec:future}.", "cites": [3890], "cite_extract_rate": 0.14285714285714285, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section introduces the topic of bias and fairness in machine learning with a few real-world examples and outlines the structure of the survey.

In addition to this, discriminatory behavior was also evident in an algorithm that would deliver advertisements promoting jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields . This advertisement was designed to deliver advertisements in a gender-neutral way. However, less women compared to men saw the advertisement due to gender-imbalance which would result in younger women being considered as a valuable subgroup and more expensive to show advertisements to. This optimization algorithm would deliver ads in a discriminatory way although its original and pure intention was to be gender-neutral. Bias in facial recognition systems  and recommender systems  have also been largely studied and evaluated and in many cases shown to be discriminative towards certain populations and subgroups. In order to be able to address the bias issue in these applications, it is important for us to know where these biases are coming from and what we can do to prevent them. \nWe have enumerated the bias in COMPAS, which is a widely used commercial risk assessment software. In addition to its bias, it also contains performance issues when compared to humans. When compared to non-expert human judgment in a study, it was discovered to be not any better than a normal human . It is also interesting to note that although COMPAS uses 137 features, only 7 of those were presented to the people in the study.  further argues that COMPAS is not any better than a simple logistic regression model when making decisions. We should think responsibly, and recognize that the application of these tools, and their subsequent decisions affect peoples' lives; therefore, considering fairness constraints is a crucial task while designing and engineering these types of sensitive tools. In another similar study, while investigating sources of group unfairness (unfairness across different groups is defined later), the authors in  compared SAVRY, a tool used in risk assessment frameworks that includes human intervention in its process, with automatic machine learning methods in order to see which one is more accurate and more fair.

An example of  this type of bias was observed in the recidivism risk prediction tool COMPAS, where \n    prior arrests and friend/family arrests were used as proxy variables to measure level of ``riskiness'' or ``crime''----which on its own can be viewed as mismeasured proxies. This is partly due to the fact that minority communities are controlled and policed more frequently, so they have higher arrest rates. However, one should not conclude that because people coming from minority groups have higher arrest rates therefore they are more dangerous as there is a difference in how these groups are assessed and controlled .\n    \\item \\textbf{Omitted Variable Bias.} \\textit{Omitted variable bias\\textsuperscript{\\ref{fl}} occurs when one or more important variables are left out of the model} . An example for this case would be when someone designs a model to predict, with relatively high accuracy, the annual percentage \n    rate at which customers will stop subscribing to a service, but soon observes that the majority of users are canceling their subscription without receiving any warning from the designed model. Now imagine that the reason for canceling the subscriptions is appearance of a new strong competitor in the market which offers the same solution, but for half the price. The appearance of the competitor was something that the model was not ready for; therefore, it is considered to be an omitted variable. \n    \\item \\textbf{Representation Bias.} \\textit{Representation bias arises from how we sample from a population during data collection process}  . Non-representative samples lack the diversity of the population, with missing subgroups and other anomalies. Lack of geographical diversity in datasets like ImageNet (as shown in Figures \\ref{imagenet1} and \\ref{imagenet2}) \n    results in demonstrable bias towards Western cultures.\n     \\item \\textbf{Aggregation Bias.} \\textit{Aggregation bias (or ecological fallacy) arises when false conclusions are drawn \n     about individuals from observing the entire population.} \n     An example of this type of bias can be seen in clinical aid tools. Consider diabetes patients who have apparent morbidity differences across ethnicities and genders. Specifically, HbA1c levels, that are widely used to diagnose and monitor diabetes, differ in complex ways across genders and ethnicities. Therefore,  \n     a model that ignores individual differences will likely not be well-suited for all ethnic and gender groups in the population~.\n     This is true even when they are represented equally in the training data. Any general assumptions about  \n     subgroups within the population can result in aggregation bias.\n    \\begin{figure}[H]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\columnwidth]{example_equal_size}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\columnwidth]{example_unbalanced}\n    \\caption{Illustration of biases in data.\n    The red line shows the regression (MLR) for the entire population, while dashed green lines are regressions for each subgroup, and the solid green line is the unbiased regression. (a) When all subgroups are of equal size, then MLR shows a positive relationship between the outcome and the independent variable. (b) Regression shows almost no relationship  in less balanced data. The relationships between  variables within each subgroup, however, remain the same.

One of the better-known examples of the type of paradox arose during the gender bias lawsuit in university admissions against UC Berkeley~.\n    After analyzing graduate school admissions data, it seemed like there was bias toward women, a smaller fraction of whom were being admitted to graduate programs compared to their male counterparts. However, when admissions data was separated and analyzed over the departments, women applicants had equality and in some cases even a small advantage over men. The paradox happened as women tended to apply to departments with lower admission rates for both genders. Simpson's paradox has been observed in a variety of domains, including biology~, psychology~,  astronomy~,  and computational social science~. \n    \\item{\\textbf{Modifiable Areal Unit Problem}} is a statistical bias in geospatial analysis, which arises when modeling data at different levels of spatial aggregation~. This bias results in different trends learned when data is aggregated at different spatial scales.\n\\end{enumerate}\n   \\item \\textbf{Sampling Bias.} \\textit{Sampling bias is similar to representation bias, and it arises due to {non-random} sampling of subgroups.} As a consequence of sampling bias, the trends estimated for one population may not generalize to data collected from a new population. For the intuition, consider the example in {Figure~\\ref{fig:explain}}. The left plot represents data collected during a study from three subgroups, which were uniformly sampled (Fig.~\\ref{fig:explain}(a)). Suppose the next time the  study was conducted, one of the subgroups was sampled more frequently than the rest (Fig.~\\ref{fig:explain}(b)). The positive trend found by the regression model in the first study almost completely disappears (solid red line in plot on the right), although the subgroup trends (dashed green lines) are unaffected.\n    \\item \\textbf{Longitudinal Data Fallacy.}\n    Researchers analyzing temporal data must use \\emph{longitudinal analysis} to track cohorts over time to learn their behavior. Instead, temporal data is often modeled using cross-sectional analysis, which combines diverse cohorts at a single time point. The heterogeneous cohorts can bias cross-sectional analysis, leading to different conclusions than longitudinal analysis. \n    As an example, analysis of bulk Reddit data~ revealed that comment length decreased over time on average. However, bulk data represented a cross-sectional snapshot of the population, which in reality contained different cohorts who joined Reddit in different years. When data was disaggregated by cohorts, the comment length within each cohort was found to increase over time.\n    \\item \\textbf{Linking Bias.}  \\textit{Linking bias arises when network attributes obtained from user connections, activities, or interactions differ and misrepresent the true behavior of the users} . In  authors show how social networks can be biased toward low-degree nodes when only considering the links in the network and not considering the content and behavior of users in the network.  also shows that user interactions are significantly different from social link patterns that are based on features, such as method of interaction or time. The differences and biases in the networks can be a result of many factors, such as network sampling, as shown in , which can change the network measures and cause different types of problems.\n    \\end{enumerate}", "cites": [3894, 8699, 7758, 3893, 6984], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2777777777777778, "origin_cites_number": 18, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section integrates several types of bias, connecting them to specific examples and citing relevant papers to support its claims.

Any biases in algorithms  might introduce biases in user behavior. In this section we talk about biases that are as a result of algorithmic outcomes and affect user behavior as a consequence.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item \\textbf{Algorithmic Bias.} \\textit{Algorithmic bias is when the bias is not present in the input data and is added purely by the algorithm}  . The algorithmic design choices, such as use of certain optimization functions, regularizations, choices in applying regression models on the data as a whole or considering subgroups, and the general use of statistically biased estimators in algorithms , can all contribute to biased algorithmic decisions that can bias the outcome of the algorithms.\n\\item \\textbf{User Interaction Bias.} \\textit{User Interaction bias is \n    a type of bias that can not only be observant on the Web but also get triggered from two sources---the user interface and through the user itself by imposing his/her self-selected biased behavior and interaction }. This type of bias can be influenced by other types and subtypes, such as presentation and ranking biases.\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item  \\textbf{Presentation Bias.} \\textit{Presentation bias is a result of how information is presented .} For example, on the Web \n    users can only click on content that they see, so the seen content gets clicks, while everything else gets no click. And it could be the case that the user does not see all the information on the Web . \n  \\item \\textbf{Ranking Bias.} \\textit{The idea that top-ranked results are the most relevant and important will result in attraction of more clicks than others}. This bias affects search engines~ and crowdsourcing applications~.\n \\end{enumerate}\n  \\item \\textbf{Popularity Bias}. \\textit{Items that are more popular tend to be exposed more. However, popularity metrics are subject to manipulation---for example, by fake reviews or social bots}  .

This bias arises as a result of change in population, cultural values, or societal knowledge usually some time after the completion of design} .

This type of bias can itself be divided into more subtypes, as discussed in detail in .\n    \\item \\textbf{Evaluation Bias.} \\textit{Evaluation bias happens during model evaluation} . This includes the use of inappropriate and disproportionate benchmarks for evaluation of applications such as Adience and IJB-A benchmarks.

Any inherent biases in users might be reflected in the data they generate. Furthermore, when user behavior is affected/modulated by an algorithm, any biases present in those algorithm might introduce bias in the data generation process. Here we list several important types of such biases.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n     \\item  \\textbf{Historical Bias.}\\textit{ Historical bias is the already existing bias and socio-technical issues in the world and can seep into from the data generation process even given a perfect sampling and feature selection } . An example of  this type of bias can be found in a 2018 image search result where searching for women CEOs ultimately resulted in fewer female CEO images due to the fact that only 5\\% of Fortune 500 CEOs were woman---which would cause the search results to be biased towards male CEOs . These search results were of course reflecting the reality, but whether or not the search algorithms should reflect this reality is an issue worth considering.\n    \\item \\textbf{Population Bias.} \\textit{Population bias arises when statistics, demographics, representatives, and user characteristics are different in the user population \n    of the platform from the original target population}  .\n    Population bias creates non-representative data. An example of this type of bias can arise  from different user demographics on different social platforms, such as women being more likely to use Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram, while men being more active in online forums like Reddit or Twitter. More such examples and statistics related to  social media use among young adults according to gender, race, ethnicity, and parental educational background can be found in .\n    \\item \\textbf{Self-Selection Bias.} \\textit{Self-selection bias\\footnote{\\label{fl}https://data36.com/statistical-bias-types-explained/} is a subtype of the  selection or sampling bias in which subjects of the research select themselves.} An example of this type of bias can be observed in an opinion poll to measure enthusiasm for a political candidate, where the most enthusiastic supporters are more likely to complete the poll. \n    \\item \\textbf{Social Bias.} \\textit{Social bias happens when others' actions affect our judgment.}  . An example of this type of bias can be a case where we want to rate or review an item with a low score, but when influenced by other high ratings, we change our scoring thinking that perhaps we are being too harsh .\n    \\item \\textbf{Behavioral Bias.} \\textit{Behavioral bias arises from different user behavior across platforms, contexts, or different datasets} . An example of this type of bias can be observed in , where authors show how differences in emoji representations among platforms can result in different reactions and behavior from people and sometimes even leading to communication errors.\n    \\item \\textbf{Temporal Bias.} \\textit{Temporal bias arises from differences in populations and behaviors over time} . An example can be observed in Twitter where  people talking about a particular topic start using a hashtag at some point to capture attention, then continue the discussion about the event without using the hashtag .\n    \\item \\textbf{Content Production Bias.} \\textit{Content Production bias arises from structural, lexical, semantic, and syntactic differences in the contents generated by users} . An example of this type of bias can be seen in  where the differences in use of language across different gender and age groups is discussed. The differences in use of language can also be seen across and within countries and populations.\n     \\end{enumerate}\nExisting work tries to categorize these bias definitions into groups, such as definitions falling solely under data or user interaction. However, due to the existence of the feedback loop phenomenon , \nthese definitions are intertwined, and we need a categorization which closely models this situation. This feedback loop is not only existent between the data and the algorithm, but also between the algorithms and user interaction . Inspired by these papers, we modeled categorization of bias definitions, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:cycle}, and grouped these definitions on the arrows of the loop where we thought they were most effective. We emphasize the fact again that these definitions are intertwined, and one should consider how they affect each other in this cycle, and address them accordingly.", "cites": [3896, 3897], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2, "origin_cites_number": 10, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes ideas from multiple sources to present a coherent categorization of user-to-data biases, particularly leveraging the concept of feedback loops.

This can bias the analysis towards dark-skinned groups who are underrepresented in the data. In another instance, the way we use and analyze our data can create bias when we do not consider different subgroups in the data. In , the authors also show that considering only male-female groups is not enough, but there is also a need to use race to further subdivide the gender groups into light-skinned females, light-skinned males, dark-skinned males, and dark-skinned females. It's only in this case that we can clearly observe the bias towards dark-skinned females, as previously dark-skinned males would compromise for dark-skinned females and would hide the underlying bias towards this subgroup. Popular machine-learning datasets that serve as a base for most of the developed algorithms and tools can also be biased---which can be harmful to the downstream applications that are based on these datasets. For instance, ImageNet  and Open Images  are two widely used datasets in machine-learning. In , researchers showed that these datasets suffer from representation bias and advocate for the need to incorporate geographic diversity and inclusion while creating such datasets.

For instance, authors in  state that in the UCI Adult dataset , a widely used dataset in the fairness domain, males on average have a higher annual income than females. However, this is because on average females work fewer hours than males per week. Work hours per week is an attribute that can be used to explain low income which needs to be considered. If we make decisions, without considering working hours, such that males and females end up averaging the same income, we will lead to reverse discrimination since we would cause male employees to get lower salary than females. Therefore, explainable discrimination is acceptable and legal as it can be explained through other attributes like working hours.

Authors in  studied the 50-year history of fairness definitions in the areas of education and machine-learning. In , authors listed and explained some of the definitions used for fairness in algorithmic classification problems. In , authors studied the general public's perception of some of these fairness definitions in computer science literature. Here we will reiterate and provide some of the most widely used definitions, along with their explanations inspired from .\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 1.} \\textit{(Equalized Odds). The definition of equalized odds, provided by , states that ``A predictor \\^{Y} satisfies equalized odds with respect to protected attribute A and outcome Y, if \\^{Y} and A are independent conditional on Y. P(\\^{Y}=1|A=0,Y =y) = P(\\^{Y}=1|A=1,Y =y) , y$\\in$\\{0,1\\}''}. This means that the probability of a person in the positive class being correctly assigned a positive outcome and the probability of a person in a negative class being incorrectly assigned a positive outcome should both be the same for the protected and unprotected group members . In other words, the equalized odds definition states that the protected and unprotected groups should have equal rates for true positives and false positives.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 2.} \\textit{(Equal Opportunity). ``A binary predictor \\^{Y} satisfies equal opportunity with respect to A and Y if P(\\^{Y}=1|A=0,Y=1) = P(\\^{Y}=1|A=1,Y=1)''}\n. This means that the probability of a person in a positive class being assigned to a positive outcome should be equal for both protected and unprotected (female and male) group members . In other words, the equal opportunity definition states that the protected and unprotected groups should have equal true positive rates.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 3.} \\textit{(Demographic Parity). Also known as statistical parity. ``A predictor \\^{Y} satisfies demographic parity if P(\\^{Y} |A = 0) = P(\\^{Y}|A = 1)''} . The likelihood of a positive outcome  should be the same regardless of whether the person is in the protected (e.g., female) group.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 4.} \\textit{(Fairness Through Awareness). ``An algorithm is fair if it gives similar predictions to similar individuals''} . In other words, any two individuals who are similar with respect to a similarity (inverse distance) metric defined for a particular task should receive a similar outcome.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 5.} \\textit{(Fairness Through Unawareness). ``An algorithm is fair as long as any protected attributes A are not explicitly used in the decision-making process''} .\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 6.} \\textit{(Treatment Equality).  ``Treatment equality is achieved when the ratio of false negatives and false positives is the same for both protected group categories''} .  \\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 7.} \\textit{(Test Fairness). ``A score S = S(x) is test fair (well-calibrated) if it reflects the same likelihood of recidivism irrespective of the individual's group membership, R. That is, if for all values of s,\nP(Y =1|S=s,R=b)=P(Y =1|S=s,R=w)''} . In other words, the test fairness definition states that for any predicted probability score S, people in both protected and unprotected groups must have equal probability of correctly belonging to the positive class .\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 8.} \\textit{(Counterfactual Fairness). ``Predictor \\^{Y} is counterfactually fair if under any context X =x and A=a,\nP($\\hat{Y}_{A\\xleftarrow{}a }$(U)=y|X =x,A=a)=P($\\hat{Y}_{A\\xleftarrow{}a'}$(U)=y|X =x,A=a), (for all y and for any value $a'$ attainable by A''} . The counterfactual fairness definition is based on the ``intuition that a decision is fair towards an individual if it is the same in both the actual world and a counterfactual world where the individual belonged to a different demographic group.''\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 9.} \\textit{(Fairness in Relational Domains). ``A notion of fairness that is able to capture the relational structure in a domain---not only by taking attributes of individuals into consideration but by taking into account the social, organizational, and other connections between individuals''} .\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Definition 10.} \\textit{(Conditional Statistical Parity). For a set of legitimate factors L, predictor \\^{Y} satisfies conditional statistical parity if P(\\^{Y} |L=1,A = 0) = P(\\^{Y}|L=1,A = 1)} . Conditional statistical parity states that people in both protected and unprotected (female and male) groups should have equal probability of being assigned to a positive outcome given a set of legitimate factors L .\n\\\\\n\\\\\nFairness definitions fall under different types as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item{\\textbf{Individual Fairness.} Give similar predictions to similar individuals }.\n\\item{\\textbf{Group Fairness.} Treat different groups equally }.\n\\item{\\textbf{Subgroup Fairness}. Subgroup fairness intends to obtain the best properties of the group and individual notions of fairness. It is different than these notions but uses them in order to obtain better outcomes. It picks a group fairness constraint like equalizing false positive and asks whether this constraint holds over a large collection of subgroups }.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ |p{5cm}||p{2cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|}\n \\hline\nName & Reference &Group & Subgroup &Individual\\\\\n \\hline\nDemographic parity&&\\checkmark && \\\\[0.5pt]\n \\hline\n Conditional statistical parity&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n \\hline\n Equalized odds &&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Equal opportunity&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Treatment equality&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Test fairness&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Subgroup fairness & && \\checkmark&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Fairness  through  unawareness&&&&\\checkmark\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Fairness  through  awareness&&&&\\checkmark\\\\[0.5pt]\n   \\hline\n   Counterfactual fairness&&&&\\checkmark\\\\[0.5pt]\n   \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Categorizing different fairness notions into group, subgroup, and individual types.}\n\\label{fairtypes}\n\\end{table}\nIt is important to note that according to , it is impossible to satisfy some of the fairness constraints at once except in highly constrained special cases. \nIn , the authors show the inherent incompatibility of two conditions: calibration and balancing the positive and negative classes. These cannot be satisfied simultaneously with each other unless under certain constraints; therefore, it is important to take the context and application in which fairness definitions need to be used into consideration and use them accordingly .\nAnother important aspect to consider is time and temporal analysis of the impacts that these definitions may have on individuals or groups. In  authors show that current fairness definitions are not always helpful and do not promote improvement for sensitive groups---and can actually be harmful when analyzed over time in some cases. They also show that measurement errors can also act in favor of these fairness definitions; therefore, they show how temporal modeling and measurement are important in evaluation of fairness criteria and introduce a new range of trade-offs and challenges toward this direction. It is also important to pay attention to the sources of bias and their types when trying to solve fairness-related questions.\\\\", "cites": [3906, 3902, 3903, 3905, 8704, 3901, 3899, 3907, 3904, 8703, 3900, 8702], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7058823529411765, "origin_cites_number": 17, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple fairness definitions from the cited papers and organizes them into a coherent framework with a clear taxonomy (individual, group, and subgroup fairness).

In this section we will enumerate different domains of AI, and the work that has been produced by each community to combat bias and unfairness in their methods. Table~\\ref{domain} provides an overview of the different areas that we focus upon in this survey. \nWhile this section is largely domain-specific, it can be useful to take a cross-domain view. Generally, methods that target biases in the algorithms fall under three categories: \n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Pre-processing.} Pre-processing techniques try to transform the data so that the underlying discrimination is removed . If the algorithm is allowed to modify the training data, then pre-processing can be used . \n    \\item \\textbf{In-processing.} In-processing techniques try to modify and change state-of-the-art learning algorithms in order to remove discrimination during the model training process . If it is allowed to change the learning procedure for a machine learning model, then in-processing can be used during the training of a model--- either by incorporating changes into the objective function or imposing a constraint .\n    \\item \\textbf{Post-processing.} Post-processing is performed after training by accessing a holdout set which was not involved during the training of the model . If the algorithm can only treat the learned model as a black box without any ability to modify the training data or learning algorithm, then only post-processing can be used in which the labels assigned by the black-box model initially get reassigned based on a function during the post-processing phase .\n\\end{enumerate}\nExamples of some existing work and their categorization into these types is shown in Table \\ref{prepost}.\nThese methods are not just limited to general machine learning techniques, but because  of \nAI's  popularity, they have expanded to different domains such as natural language processing and deep learning. From learning fair representations  to learning fair word embeddings , debiasing methods have been proposed in different AI applications and domains.\nMost of these methods try to avoid unethical interference of sensitive or protected attributes into the decision-making process, while others target exclusion bias by trying to include users from sensitive groups. In addition, some works try to satisfy one or more of the fairness notions in their methods, such as disparate learning processes (DLPs) which try to satisfy notions of treatment disparity and impact disparity by allowing the protected attributes  during the training phase but avoiding them during prediction time . A list of protected or sensitive attributes is provided in Table \\ref{electionexample}. They point out what attributes should not affect the outcome of the decision in housing loan or credit card decision-making  according to the law. Some of the existing work tries to treat sensitive attributes as noise to disregard their effect on decision-making, while some causal methods use causal graphs, and disregard some paths in the causal graph that result in sensitive attributes affecting the outcome of the decision. Different bias-mitigating methods and techniques are discussed below for different domains---each targeting a different problem in different areas of machine learning in detail. This can expand the horizon of the reader on where and how bias can affect the system and try to help researchers  carefully look at various new problems concerning  potential places where discrimination and bias can affect the outcome of a system.", "cites": [3908, 3909, 3912, 3913, 3112, 8701, 3911, 3910], "cite_extract_rate": 0.7272727272727273, "origin_cites_number": 11, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.3}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a basic overview of fair machine learning methods (pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing) and references several relevant papers, but the synthesis remains shallow, primarily listing examples rather than connecting them into a deeper narrative.

Therefore, certain methods have been proposed  that satisfy certain definitions of fairness in classification. For instance, in  authors try to satisfy subgroup fairness in classification, equality of opportunity and equalized odds in , both disparate treatment and disparate impact in , and equalized odds in . Other methods try to not only satisfy some fairness constraints but to also be stable toward change in the test set . The authors in , propose a general framework for learning fair classifiers. This framework can be used for formulating fairness-aware classification with fairness guarantees. In another work , authors propose three different modifications to the existing Naive Bayes classifier for discrimination-free classification.  takes a new approach into fair classification by imposing fairness constraints into a Multitask learning (MTL) framework. In addition to imposing fairness during training, this approach can benefit the minority groups by focusing on maximizing the average accuracy of each group as opposed to maximizing the accuracy as a whole without attention to accuracy across different groups. In a similar work , authors propose a decoupled classification system where a separate classifier is learned for each group. They use transfer learning to reduce the issue of having less data for minority groups. In  authors propose to achieve fair classification by mitigating the dependence of the classification outcome on the sensitive attributes by utilizing the Wasserstein distance measure. In  authors propose the Preferential Sampling (PS) method to create a discrimination free train data set. They then learn a classifier on this discrimination free dataset to have a classifier with no discrimination. In~, authors propose a post-processing bias mitigation strategy that utilizes attention mechanism for classification and that can provide interpretability.\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ |p{3.6cm}||p{1.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|}\n \\hline\n Algorithm&Reference&Pre-Processing&In-Processing& Post-Processing\\\\\n \\hline\n  Community detection&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n   Word embedding&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n   Optimized pre-processing&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n   Data pre-processing&&\\checkmark&&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n Classification&& &\\checkmark&\\\\[0.5pt]\n \\hline\n Regression&&&\\checkmark&\\\\[0.5pt]\n \\hline\n Classification&&&\\checkmark&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Classification&&&\\checkmark&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Adversarial learning&&&\\checkmark&\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Classification&&&&\\checkmark\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Word embedding&&&&\\checkmark\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n  Classification&&&&\\checkmark\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n   Classification&&&&\\checkmark\\\\[0.5pt]\n  \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Algorithms categorized into their appropriate groups based on being pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing.}\n\\label{prepost}\n\\end{table}", "cites": [3894, 3937, 3923, 3912, 3935, 3112, 3940, 3928, 7759, 3899, 3917, 3919, 3939, 3929, 7760], "cite_extract_rate": 0.64, "origin_cites_number": 25, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 1.8}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section primarily describes various fair classification methods from the cited papers without deeply connecting or synthesizing ideas across them.

Using causal graphs one can represent these causal relationships between variables (nodes of the graph) through the edges of the graph.

Many researchers have used causal models and graphs to solve  fairness-related concerns in machine learning. In , authors discuss in detail the subject of  causality and its importance while designing fair algorithms. There has been much research on discrimination discovery and removal that uses causal models and graphs in order to make decisions that are irrespective of sensitive attributes of groups or individuals.

By expanding on the previous work and generalizing it, authors in  propose a similar pathway approach for fair inference using causal graphs; this would restrict certain problematic and discriminative pathways in the causal graph flexibly given any set of constraints. This holds when the path-specific effects can be identified from the observed distribution. In  authors introduce the path-specific counterfactual fairness definition which is an extension to counterfactual fairness definition  and propose a method to achieve it further extending the work in . In  authors extended a formalization of algorithmic fairness from their previous work to the setting of learning optimal policies that are subject to constraints based on definitions of fairness. They describe several strategies for learning optimal policies by modifying some of the existing strategies, such as Q-learning, value search, and G-estimation, based on some fairness considerations. In  authors only target discrimination discovery and no removal by finding instances similar to another instance and observing if a  change in the protected attribute will change the outcome of the decision. If so, they declare the existence of discrimination. In , authors define the following two notions of discrimination---unresolved discrimination and proxy discrimination---as follows: \\\\\n\\textbf{Unresolved Discrimination:} \"A variable V in a causal graph exhibits unresolved discrimination if there exists a directed path from A to V that is not blocked by a resolving variable, and V itself is non-resolving\" . \\\\\n\\textbf{Proxy Discrimination:} \"A variable V in a causal graph exhibits potential proxy discrimination, if there exists a directed path from A to V that is blocked by a proxy variable and V itself is not a proxy\" .\nThey proposed methods to prevent and avoid them.

They use a maximum mean discrepancy regularizer to obtain invariance in the posterior distribution over latent variables. Adding this maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) penalty into the lower bound of their VAE architecture satisfies their proposed model for having the Variational Fair Autoencoder.\nSimilar work, but  not targeting fairness specifically, has been introduced in . In  authors also propose a debiased VAE architecture called DB-VAE which learns sensitive latent variables that can bias the model (e.g., skin tone, gender, etc.) and propose an algorithm on top of this DB-VAE using these latent variables to debias systems like facial detection systems. In  authors model their representation-learning task as an optimization objective that would minimize the loss of the mutual information between the encoding and the sensitive variable.

The model consists of two parts---the predictor and the adversary---as shown in Figure \\ref{adversary1}. In their model, the predictor is trained to predict Y given X. With the help of a gradient-based approach like stochastic gradient descent, the model tries to learn the weights W by minimizing some loss function LP($\\hat{y}$, y). The output layer is passed to an adversary, which is another network. This network tries to predict Z. \nThe adversary may have different inputs depending on the fairness definition needing to be achieved. For instance, in order to satisfy \\textbf{Demographic Parity}, the adversary would try to predict the protected variable Z using only the predicted label $\\hat{Y}$ passed as an input to it, while preventing the adversary from learning this is the goal of the predictor.

They use their newly generated synthetic data from FairGAN, which is now debiased, instead of the real data for training and testing. They do not try to remove discrimination from the dataset, unlike many of the existing approaches, but instead generate new datasets similar to the real one which is debiased and preserves good data utility.

This approach primarily relies on Glove as its base model with gender as the protected attribute. However, a recent paper  argues against these debiasing techniques and states that many recent works on debiasing word embeddings have been superficial, that those techniques just hide the bias and don't actually remove it. A recent work  took a new direction and proposed a preprocessing method for the discovery of the problematic documents in the training corpus that have biases in them, and tried to debias the system by perturbing or removing these documents efficiently from the training corpus. In a very  recent work , authors target bias in ELMo's contextualized word vectors and attempt to analyze and mitigate the observed bias in the embeddings. They show that the corpus used for training of ELMo has a significant gender skew, with male entities being nearly three times more common than female entities.

That being said, they are not claiming that these models are bias-free, but state that more sophisticated bias discovery techniques may be used in these cases, thereby  encouraging more future work in this area.", "cites": [3110, 3938], "cite_extract_rate": 1.0, "origin_cites_number": 2, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes two papers to build a narrative on bias in sentence encoders, connecting the extension of WEAT to SEAT and showing how bias detection has evolved from word to sentence-level embeddings.

However, the abstraction and synthesis are limited, as it does not fully generalize these findings into broader principles or frameworks."}}

For the second sentence, friend was translated to \"amigo,\"---the male version of friend in Spanish. This is because doctor is more stereotypical to males and nurse to females, and the model picks this bias or stereotype and reflects it in its performance. To solve this, authors in  build an approach that leverages the fact that machine translation uses word embeddings. They use the existing debiasing methods in word embedding and apply them in the machine translation pipeline. This not only helped them to mitigate the existing bias in their system, but also boosted the performance of their system by one BLUE score. In  authors show that Google's translate system can suffer from gender bias by making sentences taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics into a dozen languages that are gender neutral, including Yoruba, Hungarian, and Chinese, translating them into English, and showing that Google Translate shows favoritism toward males for stereotypical fields such as STEM jobs. In  authors annotated and analyzed the Europarl dataset , a large political, multilingual dataset used in machine translation, and discovered that with the exception of the youngest age group (20-30), which represents only a very small percentage of the total amount of sentences (0.71\\%), more male data is available in all age groups. They also looked at the entire dataset and showed that 67.39\\% of the sentences are produced by male speakers. Furthermore, to mitigate the gender-related issues and to improve morphological agreement in machine translation, they augmented every sentence with a tag on the English source side, identifying the gender of the speaker.

In particular, they observed that in a context where an entity should be tagged as a person entity, such as \"John is a person\" or \"John is going to school\", more female names as opposed to male names are being tagged as non-person entities or not being tagged at all. To further formalize their observations, authors propose six different evaluation metrics that would measure amount of bias among different genders in NER systems. They curated templated sentences pertaining to human actions and applied these metrics on names from U.S census data incorporated into the templates. The six introduced measures each aim to demonstrate a certain type of bias and serve a specific purpose in showing various results as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Error Type-1 Unweighted: Through this type of error, authors wanted to recognize the proportion of entities that are tagged as anything other than the person entity in each of the male vs female demographic groups. This could be the entity not being tagged or tagged as other entities, such as location.\n  \\[ \\frac{\\sum_{n \\in N_f}I(n_{type} \\neq PERSON)}{|N_f|}\\]\n  \\item Error Type-1 Weighted: This type of error is similar to its unweighted case except authors considered the frequency or popularity of names so that they could penalize if a more popular name is being tagged wrongfully.\n  \\[ \\frac{\\sum_{n \\in N_f}freq_f(n_{type} \\neq PERSON)}{\\sum_{n \\in N_f}freq_f(n)},\\]\nwhere $freq_f(\\cdot)$ indicates the frequency of a name for a particular year in the female census data. Likewise, $freq_m(\\cdot)$ indicates the frequency of a name for a particular year in the male census data.\n  \\item Error Type-2 Unweighted: This is a type of error in which the entity is tagged as other entities, such as location or city.

Among them are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Synthesizing a definition of fairness.} Several definitions of what would constitute fairness from a machine learning perspective have been proposed in the literature. These definitions cover a wide range of use cases, and as a result are somewhat disparate in their view of fairness. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to understand how one fairness solution would fare under a different definition of fairness. Synthesizing these definitions into one remains an open research problem since it can make evaluation of these systems more unified and comparable. having a more unified fairness definition and framework can also help with the incompatibility issue of some current fairness definitions.\n\\item \\textbf{From Equality to Equity.} The definitions presented in the literature mostly focus on \\emph{equality}, ensuring that each individual or group is given the same amount of resources, attention or outcome. However, little attention has been paid to \\emph{equity}, which is the concept that each individual or group is given the resources they need to succeed~. Operationalizing this definition and studying how it augments or contradicts existing definitions of fairness remains an exciting future direction.\n\\item \\textbf{Searching for Unfairness.} Given a definition of fairness, it should be possible to identify instances of this unfairness in a particular dataset. Inroads toward this problem have been made in the areas of data bias by detecting instances of Simpson's Paradox in arbitrary datasets~; however, unfairness may require more consideration due to the variety of definitions and the nuances in detecting each one. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth,trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm,clip=true]{new_heatmap.png}\n\\caption{Heatmap depicting distribution of previous work in fairness, grouped by domain and fairness definition.}\n\\label{heatmap}\n\\end{figure}", "cites": [7761, 3944], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 3, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section provides a thoughtful analysis of challenges in fairness research, effectively synthesizing the cited papers by connecting the theme of Simpson's Paradox to the broader issue of detecting unfairness.
