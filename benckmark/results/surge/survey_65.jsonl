The object localization is to use a bounding box (an axis-aligned rectangle tightly bounding the object) to search for the spatial location and range of an object in an image as much as possible~. Object classification is to assess the presence of objects from a given set of object classes in an image. As one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision, object detection is an indispensable technique for many high-level applications, \\eg, robot vision~, face recognition~, image retrieval~, augmented reality~, autonomous driving~, change detection~ and so on. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition~ and release of large scale dateset~, today's state-of-the-art object detector can achieve near-perfect performance under fully-supervised setting, \\ie, Fully-Supervised Object Detection (FSOD)~. Unfortunately, these fully-supervised object detection methods suffer from two inevitable limitations: 1) The large-scale instance annotations are difficult to obtain and labor-intensive. 2) When labeling these data, they may introduce annotation noises inadvertently.\nTo avoid the mentioned problems, the community starts to solve object detection in a weakly-supervised setting, \\ie, Weakly-Supervised Object Detection (WSOD). Different from the fully-supervised setting (cf. Fig.~\\ref{fsod_vs_wsod} (a)), WSOD aims to detect instances with only image-level labels (\\eg, categories of instances in the whole images). Meanwhile, WSOD can benefit from the large-scale datasets on the web, such as Facebook and Twitter. Another similar task is Weakly-Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which only detects one instance in an image. Because WSOD and WSOL detect multiple instances and single instances respectively, we consider WSOL as a sub-task of WSOD. In the following paper, we use WSOD to represent both WSOD and WSOL. \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\begin{center}\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth]{./images/fsod_vs_wsod.pdf}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{(a) Fully-Supervised Object Detection (FSOD) uses the \\emph{instance-level} annotations as supervision.

In Section~\\ref{sec:wsod}, we introduce the background, main challenges, and basic framework.

There are two types of the strategy of using context modeling as follows.\n\\textbf{Strategy A.} It selects the regions that have a big gap between their scores and their contextual region's scores as positive proposals. For example, \\blue{WSLPDA~ first replaces the pixel values within one proposal with zero to obtain the contextual region. Then, WSLPDA compares the scores of proposals and their contextual region. If the gap between the two scores is large, it indicates that the proposal is likely positive. ContextLocNet~ subtracts the localization score of one proposal from the localization score of the external rectangle region of the proposal. Then, the subtraction is considered as the final localization score of the proposal. Similar to WSLPDA and ContextLocNet, TS$^2$C~ selects a positive proposal by comparing the mean objectness scores of the pixels in one proposal and its surrounding region. But to alleviate the impact of background pixels in the surrounding region, TS$^2$C computes the mean objectness scores only using pixels with large confidence values in the surrounding region.}\n\\textbf{Strategy B.} It selects positive proposals by leveraging the loss of context regions.

PASCAL VOC 2012 consists of 5,717 training images, 5,823 validation images, and 10,991 test images.\n\\textbf{MSCOCO.} It is large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. MSCOCO has 80 object categories, 330K images ($>$200K labeled), 1.5 million object instances. In object detection, MSCOCO is as popular as PASCAL VOC datasets. Because MSCOCO has more images and categories than PASCAL VOC datasets, the difficulty of training on the MSCOCO dataset is higher than that of PASCAL VOC datasets.\n\\textbf{ILSVRC.} The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is a large-scale dataset. In ILSVRC, the model usually uses 200 fully labeled categories and 1,000 categories in object detection and object localization, respectively. ILSVRC has several versions, such as ILSVRC 2013, ILSVRC 2014, and ILSVRC 2016. Specifically, ILSVRC 2013 which is usually used in object detection has 12,125 images for training, 20,121 images for validation, and 40,152 images for testing. In addition, ILSVRC 2014 and 2016 inherit the ILSVRC 2012 dataset in object localization, which contains 1.2 million images of 1,000 categories in the training set. And ILSVRC 2012 dataset has 50,000 and 100,000 images with labels in the validation and test set, respectively.\n\\textbf{CUB-200.} Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB-200) contains 200 bird species which is a challenging image dataset. It focuses on the study of subordinate categorization. CUB-200-2011~ is an extended version of CUB-200, which adds many images for each category and labels new part localization annotations. CUB-200-2011 contains 5,994 images in the training set and 5,794 images in the test set.", "cites": [486, 895], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides factual descriptions of the datasets used in WSOD, including their sizes, categories, and splits.

It consists of precision and recall. If $tp$ denotes the number of the correct prediction samples among all of the positive samples, $fp$ denotes the number of the wrong prediction samples among all of the positive samples, and $fn$ denotes the number of the wrong prediction samples among all of the negative samples, precision and recall can be computed as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{recall} & = tp / (tp + fn), \\\\\n    \\text{precision} &= tp / (tp + fp),\n    \\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the correct prediction sample denotes IoU of the positive sample and its corresponding ground-truth box $\\geq$ 0.5. Meanwhile, the IoU is defined as\n\\begin{equation}\n    {\\rm IoU}(b, b^g) =  area(b \\cap b^g) / area(b \\cup b^g),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $b$ denotes a prediction sample, $b^g$ denotes a corresponding ground-truth box, and $area$ denotes the region size of the intersection or union. The mAP is the mean of all of the class average precisions and is a final evaluation metric of performance on the test dataset.\n\\textbf{CorLoc (Correct Localization).} CorLoc denotes the percentage of images that exist at least one instance of the prediction boxes whose IoU $\\geq$ 50\\% with ground-truth boxes for every class in these images. CorLoc is a final evaluation metric of localization accuracy on the trainval dataset.\n\\textbf{Top Error.} \\blue{Top error consists of Top-1 classification error (1-err cls), Top-5 classification error (5-err cls), Top-1 localization error (1-err loc), and Top-5 localization error (5-err loc). Specifically, Top-1 classification error is equal to $1.0 - cls_1$, where $cls_1$ denotes the accuracy of the highest prediction score (likewise for Top-1 localization error). Top-5 classification error is equal to $1.0 - cls_5$, where $cls_5$ denotes that it counts as correct if one of the five predictions with the highest score is correct (likewise for Top-5 localization error). Numerous approaches~ use top error to evaluate the performance of the model.}", "cites": [2280, 737, 2284, 2295], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8, "origin_cites_number": 5, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section primarily describes the three common evaluation metrics used in WSOD and WSOL without connecting them to the broader themes or insights from the cited papers.

The WSOD methods with ``+FR\" denote that their initial predictions are fed into the Fast R-CNN~ and serve as pseudo ground-truth bounding box annotations, \\ie, these methods transform the WSOD into FSOD problems. From the results, we can observe the performance on all three Pascal VOC datasets have achieved unprecedented progress in recent few years (\\eg, mAP 52.1\\% in CVPR'20 vs. 29.1\\% in CVPR'16 on Pascal VOC 2012). Meanwhile, comparing the methods and their counterparts with Fast R-CNN (\\eg, OICR vs. OICR+FR), we can find the detection performance can be further improved by using this FSOD transforming strategy.\n\\textbf{Results on MSCOCO.} The results of state-of-the-art WSOD methods on dataset MSCOCO are shown in Table~\\ref{table_coco}. We only report the AP metric, and the AP$_{50}$ denotes that the IoU threshold is equal to $0.5$. Similarly, the performance on MSCOCO also doubled in the last few years (\\eg, AP$_{50}$ 11.5\\% vs. 24.8\\% in test set). Since MSCOCO contains more object categories than PASCAL VOC datasets, the results on MSCOCO are still far from satisfactory. However, the performance gains by transforming WSOD to FSOD is relative marginal (\\eg, 0.7\\% gains in AP for PCL model).\n\\textbf{Results on ILSVRC 2020 and CUB-200.} TABLE~\\ref{table_ILSVRC_CUB} summaries the object localization performance of state-of-the-art WSOD methods on these two datasets. Compared to the PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO, quite few WSOD methods have evaluated their performance on these two benchmarks. From TABLE~\\ref{table_ILSVRC_CUB}, we can find the performance gains are also significant (1-err cls 35.6\\% vs. 27.7\\% in ILSVRC 2012).\n\\addtolength{\\tabcolsep}{-4.5pt}  \n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{The summary of detection results (mAp (\\%) and CorLoc (\\%)) of state-of-the-art WSOD methods on Pascal VOC 2007, 2010, and 2012 datasets.

Selective search and edge boxes are too time-consuming and yield plenty of initial proposals that most of them are negative proposal. Segmenting heatmap tends to focus on the discriminative part of the object. The performance of the sliding window is strongly dependent on the size of objects. For example, if the size of the object instance is roughly fixed, then the sliding window works very well. Otherwise, it works badly. Because these generators have inherent disadvantages, we need to design a proposal generator that can yield fewer and more accurate initial proposals. The quality of the initial proposals directly affects the detection performance of the detector. So how to yield good initial proposals may be a new research direction.\n\\textbf{Better Positive Proposals.} Most WSOD methods select the proposals with the top score as positive proposals, which tend to focus on the most discriminative parts of the object rather than the whole object region. Because of the above problem, ST-WSL~ selects positive proposals according to the number of their surrounding proposals. And Self-Taught-WS~ selects positive proposals relying on the relative improvement (RI) of the scores of each proposal of two adjacent epochs. Besides, the key of self-training and cascaded network is to select accurate proposals as the pseudo ground-truth boxes for later training. Thus, how can we design a better algorithm that can accurately select positive proposals may be an important research direction.\n\\textbf{Lightweight Network.} Today's state-of-the-art object detectors~ leverage a very deep CNN to extract image feature maps and high-dimension fully connected layers to detect object instances that can achieve satisfactory detection performance. But the deep CNN and high-dimension fully connected layers rely on large memory and strong GPU computation power. Hence, a deep network is difficult to deploy on CPU devices (\\eg, mobile phones). With the popularity of mobile devices, lightweight network with few parameters has received more and more attention from researchers, such as Light-Head R-CNN~. Thus, designing a lightweight network in weakly supervised object detection may be a new research direction.", "cites": [97, 2938, 2275, 799], "cite_extract_rate": 0.6666666666666666, "origin_cites_number": 6, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes key ideas from the cited papers by grouping them into research directions (initial and positive proposals, lightweight networks). It identifies limitations in current proposal generation methods and highlights techniques like ST-WSL and Self-Taught-WS that aim to improve proposal selection. While it provides a coherent narrative and some critical analysis of existing approaches, the insights remain largely focused on method-level observations without deeper theoretical abstraction or a novel synthesis of broader concepts."}}

Because of lacking brain's Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and X-rays images with sufficient labels, weakly-supervised brain lesion detection~ has received attention from researchers. The purpose of weakly-supervised brain lesion detection is to give the model the ability to accurately locate lesion region and classify lesion category that helps the doctor complete the diagnosis of the disease. Weakly-supervised lesion detection is not only applied in brain disease, but also other organ diseases, such as chest, abdomen, and pelvis. In addition to lesion detection, weakly-supervised learning is applied in disease prognosis~. During hospital visits, patients need to undergo a large number of tests to pinpoint their disease. These tests are generally presented to doctors and patients in the form of graphic reports. However, these numerous graphic reports lack correct labeling information. So, medical imaging may be another potential research direction in a weakly supervised setting.}\n\\textbf{3D Object Detection.} \\blue{In recent years, with the continuous improvement of the accuracy of object detection of images~, 3D object detection~ has received unprecedented attention. The purpose of 3D object detection is to detect object instances in the point cloud using 3D bounding boxes. Comparing with 2D object detection, 3D object detection tends to cost more computation and its supervision is more difficult to obtain and labor-intensive. Therefore, how to train light and accurate 3D detection models in the point cloud using simple labels may be a big challenge. Fortunately, weakly-supervised object detection is successfully applied in 2D object detection. According to the above analysis, we think that 3D weakly-supervised object detection that uses weak supervision(\\eg, 2D bounding boxes and text labels) to train object detection models in the 3D scene may be a hot research direction.}\n\\textbf{Video Object Detection.} \\blue{Video object detection~ is to classify and locate object instances in a piece of video. One of the solutions is to break the video into many frames and the detector achieves object detection in these frame images~. However, the detector will face one big problem that the quality of these frame images has deteriorated. To improve the performance of video object detection, expanding the training dataset is a good approach. Unfortunately, tagging object location and category in videos is much more difficult than in 2D images. Therefore, training video object detection in the weakly-supervised setting is necessary.}", "cites": [799, 2942, 206, 2939, 2933, 7407, 2320, 802, 2941, 7405, 209, 520, 2940], "cite_extract_rate": 0.65, "origin_cites_number": 20, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of potential application directions for weakly-supervised object detection, drawing on cited papers to highlight key challenges and opportunities in medical imaging, 3D detection, and video detection.
