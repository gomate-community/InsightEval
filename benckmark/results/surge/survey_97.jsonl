The objective of video prediction algorithms is to generate future scenes, often in the form of RGB images  and/or optical flow maps . The generated images in turn can be used for various tasks such as action prediction , event prediction , flow estimation , semantic segmentation , etc.\nVideo prediction applications rely on generative models whose task is to predict future scene(s) based on a short observation of input sequences (or in some cases only a single image ). Although many approaches use feedforard architectures , the majority of algorithms take advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) , Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks , its variation Convolutional LSTMs (ConvLSTMs) or a combination of these .\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are particularly popular in the video prediction community. . In these adversarial training frameworks, there are two compoents: A generative network that produces future representations and  a discriminator whose objective is to distinguish between the predicted representations (e.g. optical flow , frames , motion ) or their temporal consistency  and the actual ground truth data by producing a binary classification score that indicates whether the prediction is real or fake. While many algorithms use discriminators to judge how realistic the final generated images  are or intermediate features (e.g. poses ), others use multiple discriminators at different stages of processing.  For example, the authors of  use two discriminators, one is responsible for judging the temporal consistency of the generated frames (i.e. whether the order of generated frames is real) and the other assesses whether the generated frames are real or not. Lee et al.  use three discriminators to assess the quality of generated frames and the intermediate motion and content features. Using a two-stream approach, the method in  produces both the next frame and optical flow and each stream is trained with a separate discriminator. The prediction network of  uses a discriminator for intermediate features generated from input scenes and another discriminator for the final results.\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs)  or Conditional VAEs (CVAEs)  are also used in some approaches . VAEs model uncertainty in generated future frames by defining a posterior distribution over some latent variable space . In CVAEs, the posterior is conditioned on an additional parameter such as the observed action in the scenes  or initial observation . Using VAEs, at inference time, a random sample is drawn from the posterior to generate the future frame.\nMany video prediction algorithms operate solely on input images and propose various architectural innovations for encoding the content and generating future images . For example, the method in  performs a two-way prediction, forward and backward. Each prediction relies on two discriminators for assessing the quality of the generated images and temporal consistency. The model presented in  trains a context network by inputting an image sequence into a ConvLSTM whose output is used to initialize convolutional networks responsible for generating the next frames.  Xu et al.  , in addition to raw pixel values, encode the output of a high pass filter applied to the image as a means of maintaining the structural integrity of the objects in the scene. In , the authors use a two-step approach in which they first perform a coarse frame prediction followed by a fine frame prediction. In , the algorithm learns in two stages. A discriminator is applied after features are generated from the scenes and another one after the final generated frames. \nOptical flow prediction has been widely used as an intermediate step in video prediction algorithms . For example, to deal with occlusion in dynamic scenes, Gao et al.  disentangle flow and pixel-level predictions into two steps: the algorithm first predicts the flow of the scene, and then uses it, in conjunction with the input frames, to predict the future. Similar multi-step approaches have also been used in . In , the authors use two separate branches: one branch receives two consecutive frames $(t, t+1)$ and produces context information. The second branch produces motion information by receiving two frames that are $k$ steps apart (i.e. $t+1$, $t+k$). The outputs of these two branches are fused and fed into the final scene generator.  The method in  simultaneously produces the next future frame and the corresponding optical flow map. In this architecture, two additional networks are used: A flow estimator which uses the output of the frame generator and the last observation to estimate a flow map and a warping layer which performs differential 2D spatial transformation to warp the last observed image into the future predicted frame according to the predicted flow map. \nSome algorithms rely on various intermediate steps for video prediction. For instance, the method in , reasons about the locations and features of individual entities (e.g. cubes) for final scene predictions.  Kim et al.  first identify keypoints, which may correspond to important structures such as joints, and then predict their motion. For videos involving humans, in  the authors identify and reason about the changes in poses, and use this information to generate future frames. In , in addition to raw input images, the differences between consecutive frames used in the learning process.\nPrediction networks can also be provided with additional information to guide future frame generation. In  an optical flow network and in  a pose estimation network are used in addition to RGB images. Using a CVAE architecture, in  the authors use the action lables as conditional input for frame generation. In the context of active tasks, e.g. object manipulation with robotic arms, in which the consequences of actions influence the future scene configuration, it is common to condition the future scene generation on the current or future intended actions .", "cites": [2804, 2814, 2817, 2807, 2808, 2816, 5680, 2819, 2815, 2806, 2809, 2818, 2811, 2802, 2820, 2810, 2805, 2812, 8590, 7617, 2803, 2813, 2073], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5897435897435898, "origin_cites_number": 39, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by grouping diverse papers around architectural components, training methods, and intermediate representations (e.g., optical flow and pose).

Although the majority of these algorithms use sequences in which the objects and agents are fully observable, a number of methods rely on egocentric scenes  which are recorded from the point of view of the acting agents and only parts of their bodies (e.g. hands) are observable.\nAction prediction methods predominantly use a variation of RNN-based architectures including LSTMs , GRUs , ConvLSTMs , and Quasi-RNNs (QRNNs) . For instance, in  the authors use a graph-based RNN architecture in which the nodes represent actions and the edges of the graph represent the transitions between the actions. The method in  employs a two-step approach: using a recognition algorithm, the observed actions and their durations are recognized. These form a one-hot encoding vector which is fed into GRUs for the prediction of the future activities, their corresponding start time and length. In the context of vehicle behavior prediction, Ding et al.  uses a two-stream GRU-based architecture to encode the trajectory of two vehicles and a shared activation unit to encode the vehicles mutual interactions. Scheel et al.  encode the relationship between the ego-vehicle and surrounding vehicles in terms of their mutual distances.  The vectorized encoding is then fed into a bi-directional LSTM. At each time step, the output of the LSTM is classified, using a softmax activation, into a binary value indicating whether it is safe for the ego-vehicle to change lane. In  the authors use a QRNN network to capture the relationships between road users in order to predict the likelihood of a traffic accident. To train the model, the authors propose an adaptive loss function that assigns penalty weights depending on how early the model can predict accidents. \nAs an alternative to recurrent architectures, some algorithms use feedforward architectures using both 3D  and 2D  convolutional networks. For example, in the context of pedestrian crossing prediction, in  the authors use a generative 3D CNN model that produces future scenes and is followed by a classifier.  The method of  detects and tracks pedestrians in the scenes, and then feeds the visual representations of the tracks, in the form of an image sequence, into a 3D CNN architecture, which directly classifies how likely the pedestrian will cross the road. To predict the time of traffic accidents, the method in  processes each input image using a 2D CNN model and then combines the representations followed by a fully-conntected (\\textit{fc}) layer for prediction. Farha et al.  create a 2D matrix by stacking one-hot encodings of actions for each segment of observation and use a 2D convolutional net to generate future actions encodings. Casas et al.  use a two-stream 2D CNN, each processing the stacked voxelized LIDAR scans and the scene map. The feature maps obtained from each stream are fused and fed into a backbone network followed by three headers responsible for the detection of the vehicles and predicting their intentions and trajectories. For sports forecasting, Felsen et al.   concatenate 5 image observations channel-wise and feed the resulting output into a 2D CNN network comprised of 4 convolutional layers and an \\textit{fc} layer.\nAlthough some algorithms rely on a single source of information, e.g. a set of pre-processed features from RGB images  or trajectories , many algorithms use a multimodal approach by using various sources of information such as optical flow maps , poses , scene attributes (e.g. road structure, semantics) , text , action labels , length of actions , speed (e.g. ego-vehicle or surrounding agents) , gaze , current activities  and the time  of the actions. For example, the method in  uses a multi-stream LSTM in which two LSTMs encode visual features and cooking recipes and an LSTM decodes them for final predictions. To capture the relationships within and between sequences,  Gammulle et al.  propose a two-stream LSTM network with external neural memory units. Each stream is responsible for encoding visual features and action labels. In , a multi-layer GRU structure is used in which features with different modalities enter the network at different levels and are fused with the previous level encodings. The fusion process is taking place according to the complexity of the data modality, e.g. more complex features such as encodings of pedestrian appearances enter the network at the bottom layer, whereas location and speed features enter at the second-last and last layers respectively. Farha et al.  use a two-layer stacked GRU architecture which receives as input a feature tuple of the length of the activity and its corresponding one-hot vector encoding. In , the method uses a two-stage architecture: First information regarding the appearance of the scene, optical flow (pre-processed using a CNN) and vehicle dynamics are fed into individual LSTM units. Then, the output of these units is combined and passed through an \\textit{fc} layer to create a representation of the context. This representation is used by another LSTM network to predict future traffic actions. In the context of human-robot interaction, the authors of  combine the information regarding the gaze and pose of the humans using an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture to predict their next actions. Jain et al.  use a fusion network to combine head pose information of the driver, outside scene features, GPS information, and vehicle dynamics to predict the driver's next action.\nBefore concluding this section, it is important to discuss the use of attention modules which have gained popularity in recent years . As the name implies, the objective of attention modules is to determine what has to be given more importance at a given time. These modules can come in different froms and can be applied to different dimensions of data and at various processing. Some of these modules are temporal attention  for identifying keyframes, modality attention  to prioritize between different modalities of data input, spatial attention  for highlighting the important parts of the scenes, and graph attention  for weighting nodes of the graph. In some cases, a combination of different attention mechanisms is used  .", "cites": [2829, 2837, 7117, 2838, 2832, 2828, 2825, 2806, 2834, 2835, 2827, 2826, 2831, 2836, 2833, 7618, 2839, 2830], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4864864864864865, "origin_cites_number": 37, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.3, "critical": 3.2, "abstraction": 3.8}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by integrating diverse action anticipation methods, connecting them through shared themes like architecture (RNNs vs. CNNs) and multimodal inputs.

Although many of these algorithms use similar aproaches to action anticipation algorithms, some propose new approaches.

They perform knowledge distillation by linking feature representations of both networks. Using GAN frameworks, the methods in  predict future feature representations of videos in order to predict actions. Zhao et al.  implement a Kalman filter using an LSTM architecture. In this method, actions are predcted after observing each frame and corrections are made if the next observation provide additional information. The method of  uses a two-step LSTM architecture which first generates an encoding of the context using context-aware convolutional features and then combines these encodings with action-aware convolutional features to predict the action. The authors of this method propose a new loss function that penalizes false negatives with the same strength at any point in time and false positives with a strength that increases linearly over time, to reach the same weight as that on false negatives. In  the authors perform coarse-to-fine-grained predictions depending on the amount of evidence available for the type of action. \nMany early action prediction methods adopt feedforward architectures . The authors of  predict actions from a single image by transforming it into a new representation called Ranked Saliency Map and Predicted Optical Flow.  This representation is passed through a 2D convent and \\textit{fc} layers for final prediction.

These approaches are particularly popular for applications such as intelligent driving and surveillance. Predicted trajectories can be used directly, e.g. in route planning for autonomous vehicles, or used for predicting future events, anomalies, or actions. \nIn this section, we follow the same routine as before and focus on algorithms that have a deep learning component while acknowledging many recent works that have used classical approaches including Gaussian mixture models  and processes , Markov decision processes (MDPs) , Markov chains  and other techniques .\nTrajectory prediction applications like many other sequence prediction tasks heavily rely on recurrent architectures such as LSTMs , and GRUs  . These methods often use an encoder-decoder architecture in which a network, e.g. an LSTM encodes single- or multi-modal observations of the scenes for some time, and another network generates future trajectories given the encoding of the observations. Depending on the complexity of input data, these algorithms may rely on some form of pre-processing for generating features or embedding mechanisms to minimize the dimensionality of the data.\nThe feedforward algorithms   often use whole views of the scenes (i.e. the environment and moving objects) and encode them using convolutional layers followed by a regression layer to predict trajectories. A few algorithms use hybrid approaches in which both convolutional and recurrent reasoning are also used .  \nDepending on the prediction task, algorithms may rely on single- or multi-modal observations. For example, in the context of visual surveillance where a fixed camera provide a top-down or bird-eye viewing angle, many algorithms only use past trajectories of the agents in either actual 2D frame coordinates or their velocities calculated by the changes from each time step to another . In addition to observations of individual trajectories of agents, these algorithms focus on modeling the interaction between the agents and how they impact each other. For example, Zhang et al.  use a state refinement module that aligns all pedestrians in the scene with a message passing mechanism that receives as input the current locations of the subjects and their encodings from an LSTM unit. In  a graph-based approach is used where pedestrians are considered as nodes and the interactions between them as edges of the graph. By aggregating information from neighboring nodes, the network learns to assign a different level of importance to each node for a given subject. The authors of   perform a pooling operation on the generated representations by sharing the state of individual LSTMs that have spatial proximity. \nAs shown in some works, other sources of information are used in surveilling objects . For example, in addition to encoding the interactions with the environment, Liang et al.  use the semantic information of the scene as well as changes in the poses of the pedestrians. In  the visual representations of the layout of the environment and the appearances of the subjects are included. The authors of  use an occupancy map which highlights the potential traversable locations for the subjects. The method in  takes into account pedestrians' head orientations to estimate their fields of view in order to predict which subjects would potentially interact with one another. To predict interactions between humans, in  the authors use both poses and trajectories of the agents. Ma et al.   go one step further and take into account the pedestrians' characteristics (e.g. age, gender) within a game-theoretic perspective to determine how the trajectory of one pedestrians impact each other.\nIn the context of traffic understanding, predicting trajectories can be more challenging due to the fact that there is camera ego-motion involved (e.g. the prediction is from the perspective of a moving vehicle), there are interactions between different types of objects (e.g. vehicles and pedestrians), and there are certain constraints involved such as traffic rules, signals, etc. To achieve robustness, many methods in this domain take advantage of multi-modal data for trajectory prediction . In addition to using past trajectories, all these algorithms account for the road structure (whether it is from the perspective of the ego-vehicle or a top-down view) often in the form of raw visual inputs or, in some cases, as an occupancy map . The scene layout can implicitly capture the structure of the road, the appearances of the objects (e.g. shape) and the dynamics (e.g. velocity or locations of subjects). Such implicit information can be further augmented by explicit data such as the shapes of the objects (in the case of vehicles) , the speed  and steering angle  of the ego-vehicle, the distance between the objects , traffic rules  and signals , and kinematic constraints . For example, the method in  uses a two-stream LSTM encoder-decoder scheme: first stream encodes the current ego-vehicle's odometry (steering angle and speed) and the last observation of the scene and predicts future odometry of the vehicle. The second stream is a trajectory stream that jointly encodes location information of pedestrians and the ego-vehicle's odometry and then combines the encoding with the prediction of the odometry stream to predict the future trajectories of the pedestrians. The method in  further extends this approach and adds an intention prediction stream which outputs how likely the observed pedestrian intends to cross the street. The intention likelihood is produced using an LSTM network that encodes the dynamics of the pedestrian, their appearances and their surroundings. Chandra et al.  create embeddings of contextual information by taking into account the shape and velocity of the road users and their spatial coordinates within a neighboring region. These embeddings are then fed into some LSTM networks followed by a number of convolutional layers to capture the dynamics of the scenes. In  the authors use separate LSTMs for encoding the trajectories of pedestrians and vehicles (as orientated bounding boxes) and then combine them into a unified framework by generating an occupancy map of the scene centered at each agent, followed by a pooling operation to capture the interactions between different subjects. Lee et al.  predict the future trajectories of vehicles in two steps: First, an encoder-decoder GRU architecture predicts future trajectories by observing the past ones. Then a refinement network adjusts the predicted trajectories by taking into account the contextual information in the forms of social interactions, dynamics of the agents involved, and the road structure.\nSimilar to action prediction algorithms, attention modules have been widely used in trajectory prediction methods . For example, in  , the attention module jointly measures spatial and temporal interactions. The authors of  propose the use of social attention modules which estimate the relative importance of interactions between the subject of interest and its neighboring subjects. The method in   uses two attention mechanisms, a temporal attention module that measures the importance of each timestep of the observed trajectories and a series of self-attention modules which are applied to encodings of observations prior to predictions. Xue et al.   propose an attention mechanism to measure the relative importance between different data modalities, namely the locations and velocities of subjects.\nOne of the major challenges in trajectory prediction is to model uncertainty of predictions, especially in scenarios where many possibilities exist (e.g. pedestrians at intersections).  Some algorithms such as  train the models by directly measuring the error between the ground truth trajectories and predicted ones, e.g. by using an \\textit{L2} objective function. At the inference time, these algorithms generate deterministic predictions. To measure the uncertainty of predictions, these models are trained multiple times with randomly initialized parameters. Alternatively, uncertainty can be estimated via probabilistic objective functions, e.g. Gaussian log-likelihood, as in   Instead of a single point in space, these algorithms predict a distribution that captures the uncertainty of the predictions. VAEs are another technique that can be used to estimate uncertainty . Using these methods, at training time a posterior distribution over some latent space $z$ is learned by conditioning, for example, over future trajectories. At the inference time, a random sample is drawn from the latent space for the predictions.\nSince trajectory prediction algorithms are generative by nature, many approaches rely on adversarial training techniques  in which at training time a discriminator is used to predict whether the generated trajectories are real or fake. Kosaraju et al.  extend this approach by using two discriminators: A local discriminator which predicts the results on the output of the prediction using only past trajectories, and one global discriminator which operates on the output of the entire network, i.e. the prediction results based on trajectories and scene information.", "cites": [2867, 2855, 2847, 2860, 2854, 2853, 2868, 2857, 2869, 2856, 2846, 2862, 2852, 2866, 979, 988, 2858, 2859, 2848, 2850, 2865, 2831, 2851, 8591, 1261, 2861, 2863, 2849, 7379, 2830, 2864], "cite_extract_rate": 0.4246575342465753, "origin_cites_number": 73, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.2, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by connecting multiple papers under themes like recurrent vs. feedforward architectures, multimodal inputs, and attention mechanisms.

Motion prediction play a  fundamental role in all prediction approaches as an intermediate step, e.g. to reflect how the future visual representations would look like or the types of actions to anticipate. Like many other prediction applications, this field is dominated by deep learning models, even though some methods still rely on classical techniques .\nSimilar to other prediction algorithms, motion prediction methods widely use recurrent architectures such as LSTMs  and GRUs  or a combination of both . For example, in  the authors use a two-layer GRU model in which the top layer operates backward to learn noise processes and the bottom level is used to predict the poses given the past pose observations and the output of the top layer. Chiu et al.  propose a hierarchical LSTM architecture in which each layer of the network encodes the observed poses at different time-scales. In the context of 3D pose prediction, some algorithms rely on a two-stage process where the visual inputs, either as a single image  or a sequence of images , are fed into a recurrent network to predict 2D poses of the agent. This is followed by a refinement procedure that transforms the 2D poses into 3D. \nSome approaches adopt feedforward architectures . For example, the method in   uses two feedforward networks in a two-stage process. First, the input poses are fed into an autoencoder which is comprised of fully connected layerss (implemented by 1D convolutions with a kernel size of 1) and self-attention blocks. The encodings are then used by multi-level 2D convolutional blocks for final predictions. Zhang et al.  predict 3D poses from RGB videos. In their method, the images are converted to a feature space using a convolutional network, and then the features are used to learn a latent 3D representation of 3D human dynamics. The representation is used by a network to predict future 3D poses. To capture movement patterns, a method proposed in  converts poses into a trajectory space using discrete cosine transformation.

The most straightforward way of computing the disparity is to measure pixel-wise error using a Mean Square Error (MSE) , which computes average squared intensity differences between pixels. Another more popular metric related to MSE is Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) . PSNR is the ratio of the maximum pixel value (i.e. possible signal power), e.g. 255 in 8-bit images, divided by the MSE (or power of distorting noise) measure of two images. The lower the error between two images, the higher the value of PSNR, and consequently, the higher the quality of the generated images. Because of the wide dynamic range of signals, PSNR value is expressed in the logarithmic decibel scale. \nAlthough MSE, and PSNR metrics are easy to calculate, they cannot measure the perceived visual quality of a generated image. An alternative metric to address this issue is Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index ()   which is designed to model image distortion. To capture the structural differences between the two images, SSIM separates illumination information as it is independent of objects' structures. As a result, the similarity is measured by a combination of three comparisons, namely luminance, contrast, and structure. \nHigher-level contextual similarities may not be captured by distance measures on pixel values. More recently proposed metric, Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), ()  measures the similarity between two images by comparing internal activations of convolutional networks trained for high-level classification tasks. The value is calculated by an average L2 distance over normalized deep features.\nSome other metrics that have been used in the literature are qualitative human judgment , Frechet Video Distance (FVD) () , Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) , Inception Scores (IS) () , Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) , L1 , and Root MSE (RMSE) .", "cites": [2804, 2814, 2817, 2807, 2808, 2816, 2819, 2815, 2806, 117, 2809, 2818, 7620, 2811, 2802, 2820, 2810, 491, 2805, 2812, 8590, 7617, 2813, 2890], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5853658536585366, "origin_cites_number": 41, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section primarily describes common video prediction metrics (e.g., MSE, PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and briefly mentions other evaluation techniques, but it does not synthesize or integrate the cited papers effectively.

This is because, for example, the model can simply favor the more represented class and predict every input as that class. This then would result in a high accuracy measure because the metric only considers the ratio of correct predictions.

It is also a common practice that instead of using average or final time step measures, to calculate the error at different time steps over a period of time .\nTo measure displacement error in probablistic trajectory prediction algorithms, some works generate a set number of samples and report the best measure (i.e. minimum error)   or average over all samples .

For example, for measuring displacement error, although many algorithms use Euclidean Distance (ED) (aka L2-distance, L2-norm, Euclidean norm) , many others rely on different error metrics including MSE , RMSE , Weighted RMSE , Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Hausdorff Distance (HD), Modified HD (MHD) , and discrete Fr\\'echet distance (DFD) . Moreover, trajectory prediction algorithms use different units for measuring displacement error. These are meter , pixel , normalized pixel  and feet .\nAlthough such discrepancy between error metrics and units is expected across different applications, the problem arises when the proposed works do not specify the error metric , the unit of measure  or both . Despite the fact that the reported results might imply the choice of the metrics and units, the lack of specification can cause erroneous comparisons, specially because many authors use the results of previous works directly as reported in the papers.\nUnfortunately, metric and unit discrepancy exists within the same applications and the same error measuring techniques. For instance, in the case of ADE measure, this metric is originally proposed in  in terms of ED, and was referred to as ADE by the authors of  despite the fact that they used MSE instead. This is also apparent in many subsequent works that employed ADE measure. For example, the majority of methods use the original metric and report the results in terms of ED   whereas some works use MSE  and RMSE or do not specify the metric  . Although the formulation of these metrics look similar, they produce different results. ADE using ED, for example, is square-root of squared differences averaged over all samples and time steps. Unlike ED, in RMSE, the averaging takes place inside square-root operation. MSE, on the other hand, is very different from the other two metrics, and does not calculate the root of the error. As we can also see in some of the past works, this discrepancy may cause confusion about the intended and actual metric that is used. For example, in  the authors propose to use MAE metric while presenting mathematical formulation of Euclidean distance. The authors of  make a similar mistake and define ED formulation but refer to it as MSE.\nIn addition, some algorithms within the same applications and using the same datasets use different measuring unit. For instance, in the context of surveillance, ETH  is one of the most commonly used datasets. Many works use this dataset for benchmarking the performance of their proposed algorithms, however, they either use different units, e.g. meter , pixel , normalized pixel , or do not specify the unit used .\nLast but not least, another potential source of error in performance evaluation is in the design of the experiments. Taking surveillance applications as an example, it is a common practice to evaluate algorithms with 8 frames observations of the past and prediction 12 steps in the future  . However, in some cases the performance of state-of-the-art is reported under the standard 8/12 condition, but the proposed algorithms are tested under different conditions.

Discussing all datasets in detail is beyond the scope of this paper. We provide a summary of the datasets and their characteristics in Tables \\ref{dataset_table1} and \\ref{dataset_table2} and briefly discuss more popular datasets in each field. Figure \\ref{datasets_fig} illustrates the list of papers and corresponding datasets used for evaluation. Note that the papers that do not use publicly available datasets are not listed in this figure. For further information, the readers can also refer to Appendices \\ref{links_datasets} and \\ref{papers_datasets}. \n\\textbf{Video prediction.} Almost any forms of  sequential RGB images can be used for evaluation of video prediction algorithms. Among the most common datasets are traffic datasets such a KITTI , and Caltech Pedestrians . KITTI is a dataset recorded from inside of a vehicle and contains images of urban roads annotated with bounding box information. It also contains depth maps, LIDAR point clouds and semantic segmentation maps. Caltech Pedestrian is a similar dataset with the difference of only containing RGB images and bounding boxes for pedestrians. It also contains occlusion bounding boxes highlighting the visible portions of the pedestrians. Activity datasets such as UCF-101  and Human3.6M  are also widely used. UCF-101 contains videos of various types of activities such as sports, applying makeup, playing music instruments annotated with activity labels per video. Human3.6M consists of 3.6 million 3D human poses and corresponding images recorded from 11 professional actors. This dataset contains 17 generic scenarios such as discussion, smoking, and taking photos.\n\\textbf{Action prediction. } The algorithms in this domain are evaluated on a wide range of datasets. For anticipation tasks, traffic datasets such as Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)  and Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD)  are used.  NGSIM contains trajectories of vehicles driving on highways in the United States. The trajectories are accompanied by the top-down views of the corresponding road structures.   The JAAD dataset contains videos of pedestrians crossing the road recorded using an on-board camera. This dataset contains the frame-wise pedestrian bounding boxes, and action labels as well as pedestrians' and roads' attributes. A similar dataset to JAAD is Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE)  which, in addition, provides the ego-vehicle sensor data and spatial annotations for traffic elements.\nAnother popular category of datasets in this domain is those containing videos of cooking activities. These datasets are  Epic-Kitchen , 50salads , Breakfast  and MPII-Cooking . These datasets contain videos showing sequences of different cooking actions of preparing meals. All videos in the datasets have temporal segments with corresponding activity labels. Some datasets also provide additional annotations such as object bounding boxes, voice and text in  Epic-Kitchen, and the poses of the actors in MPII-Cooking. \nEarly action prediction works widely use the popular UCF-101 dataset  and interaction datasets such as UT Interaction (UTI)  and BIT . UTI and BIT contain videos of people engaged in interaction with the corresponding label for the types of interactions. In addition, UTI has the added temporal segment annotations detailing different stages of interactions.\n\\textbf{Trajectory prediction. } The most common datasets in this domain are ETH  and UCY  which contain surveillance videos of pedestrians walking on sidewalks annotated with their position coordinates. UCY also provides the gaze directions to capture the viewing angle of pedestrians. Another popular dataset is Stanford Aerial Pedestrian (SAP), also known as Stanford Drone (SD) . This dataset has the footage of road users from a top-down view recorded by a drone. The annotations include bounding boxes and object class labels. \n\\textbf{Motion prediction. } The algorithms in this domain are mainly evaluated on the widely popular dataset Human 3.6M  described earlier. This dataset is particularly suitable for these applications because it contains accurate 3D poses of the actors recorded by a high-speed motion capture system. Using this dataset, the background  can be accurately removed allowing the algorithms to focus purely on changes in the poses. Another popular dataset in this field is Penn Action  which contains RGB videos of various activities with corresponding activity labels and poses of the actors involved. \n\\textbf{Other applications. } The most notable datasets are KITTI  which is used by the OGM prediction algorithms and CityScapes  that is used by the segmentation prediction algorithms. CityScapes contains video footage of urban environments recorded by an on-board camera. The data is annotated with semantic masks of the traffic objects and corresponding bounding boxes.", "cites": [2899, 2838, 2808, 2869, 2824, 2892, 8596, 2835, 2897, 1517, 2903, 8590, 2894, 6980, 2891, 2900, 2626, 2908, 2906, 2896, 2905, 2898, 2902, 8597, 1733, 2904, 2907, 2893, 2878, 2851, 7379, 2901, 2880, 2895], "cite_extract_rate": 0.336283185840708, "origin_cites_number": 113, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 1.5}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a descriptive overview of datasets used in vision-based prediction, primarily listing them in a table with minimal narrative explanation.
