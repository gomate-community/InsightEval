For example, an adversary may first try to explore the target network and try to figure out its topology, bandwidth, software deployed on the different nodes, {\\em etc.}, but it may also need to perform reconnaissance at an advanced stage, say, to verify if it has actually gained access and established a foothold, i.e. a new vantage point, within the system. The knowledge gained in the exploration phase helps them to execute attacks that exploit the system, to move to different points in the network, and exfiltrate important information.\nAs both exploration and attack traffic are malicious in nature, they tend to differ from legitimate user traffic. At that point, the detection and prevention surfaces come into play.\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:what}, we show a Venn diagram that categorizes existing MTDs based on the surface they shift. Although this categorization is at a level of abstraction, we discuss various works and show how different MTDs define the elements of the set $C$. Most MTDs shift one surface at a time, rarely considering scenarios where other surfaces can be shifted in conjunction.

Unfortunately, placing all possible Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on a system, especially in the case of a large network system, can lead to a degradation in the performance of the system. Thus, to minimize the impact on performance while keeping the attacker guessing about whether their attack will be detected or not, researchers have looked at intelligent ways in which a limited number of detection systems can be placed on the underlying network. These methods are similar to patrolling methods that try to identify security breaches in physical security domains like airports, wildlife sanctuaries, {\\em etc.} with limited resources .\nIn  and , authors show that when faced with stealthy botnets and external adversaries, who are powerful enough to attack any internal node of a deployed system, shifting the detection surface helps to maintain system performance, while being effective in detecting attacks.  In both of these cases, they have a set of nodes $N$ that are deployed in the network. The configuration set $C$ is composed of all $k$-sized subsets of $N$ (where $k (< |N|)\\}$). In , the authors argue that in many real-world multi-layered networks, the assumption that an attacker can attack from any place in the network is too strong and split the configuration set $C$ into disjoint sets based their position in on an attack graph.\nIn contrast to MTD for detection surface shifting, whose goal is to maximize security while adhering to performance constraints of the underlying network, some works investigate detection surface shifting for the sole purpose of enhancing security. In , the authors use an ensemble of classifiers that can distinguish a mail as spam and switch between them to make it more difficult for the attacker to fool the system. In general, the use of machine learning for anomaly detection  coupled with the paradigm of MTD for stochastic ensembles  can lead to interesting future research, especially the introduction of a new attack surface (authors in  highlight several challenges in the use of supervised machine learning in cloud network settings). In these cases, each classifier is a configuration in $C$.\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n\\begin{scope}[ opacity=0.6]\n    \\fill[CornflowerBlue!30!white,draw=black] (180:3.5) ellipse (5 and 3.9);\n    \\fill[Goldenrod!30!white,draw=black]  (360:3.5) ellipse (5 and 3.9);\n \\end{scope}    \n    \\node at (140:4.9) {\\textbf{Constant Period Shifting}};\n    \\node at (145:4.5) {Zhu et al.~};\n    \\node at (152:4.5) {Manadhata et al.~};\n    \\node at (159:4.5) {Albanese et al.~};\n    \\node at (166:4.5) {Carter et al.~};\n    \\node at (173:4.5) {Sengupta et al.~};\n    \\node at (180:4.5) {Colbaugh et al.~};\n    \\node at (187:4.5) {Jafarian et al.~};\n    \\node at (194:4.5) {Venkatesan et al.~};\n    \\node at (201:4.5) {Jajodia et al.~};\n    \\node at (208:4.5) {Thompson et al.~};\n    \\node at (215:4.5) {Debroy et al.~};\n    \\node at (222:4.55) {Aydeger et al.~};\n    \\node at (226:4.95) {Algin et al.~};\n    \\node at (0:0) {Clark et al.~};\n    \\node at (36:4.6) {\\textbf{Variable Period Switching}};\n    \\node at (28:4.2) {\\textbf{$\\bullet$ On event switching}};\n    \\node at (21:4.2) {Van et al.~};\n    \\node at (14:4.2) {Prakash et al.~};\n    \\node at (7:4.2) {Zhao et al.~};\n    \\node at (0:4.2) {Neti et al.~};\n    \\node at (353:4.2) {Chowdhary et al.~};\n    \\node at (346:4.2) {Shi et al.~};\n    \\node at (336:4.2) {\\textbf{$\\bullet$ Strategic}};\n    \\node at (329:4.4) {Lei et al.~};\n    \\node at (322:4.7) {El Mir et al.~};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\caption{The time period between two move events is either a fixed interval or decided based on some form of reasoning in the various Moving Target Defenses proposed in the literature.}\n\\label{fig:when}\n\\end{figure*}", "cites": [6794, 6795, 6792, 6793], "cite_extract_rate": 0.13333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 30, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple papers into a coherent discussion of detection surface shifting, integrating ideas on system performance, attacker assumptions, and machine learning.

In most cases, the switch action is triggered immediately. \nA well-known case study is that of the \\emph{FlipIt} games .

In these settings, the goal is to come up with a single mixed-strategy that can be played in all configurations (or states). Thus, the movement function $M: H\\rightarrow C$ is independent of any history or $H = \\emptyset$. As we shall see, the different works consider various notions of equilibrium to come up with this mixed-strategy.\nIn , the configuration of the system is modified by a pair of actions, one by the defender and one by the attacker. The defender's action, in this case, maps a value of system features represented by the set $F$ to one of the possible actions in the set $\\{enabled,~disabled,~modified,~unchanged\\}$. The attacker's action set $A^\\mathcal{A}$ is comprised of conceptually opposite actions that can {\\em dis-enable} a port, {\\em disable} a functionality, {\\em etc.} and the rewards, $R^\\mathcal{A}$ and $R^\\mathcal{D}$ for the attacker and the defender, are given by weighing the change in system's features $\\Delta F$, i.e. the change in the attack surface $\\Delta AS$ and the attack surface measurement $\\Delta ASM$, as follows.\n\\[\nR^\\mathcal{D}(s,a^\\mathcal{D},a^\\mathcal{A}) = B_1(\\Delta F) + B_2(\\Delta AS) - D_1(\\Delta ASM)\n\\]\n\\[\nR^\\mathcal{A}(s,a^\\mathcal{D},a^\\mathcal{A}) = B_3(\\Delta ASM) - D_2(\\Delta AS)\n\\]\nwhere the $B_i$ and $D_j$ are weights defined by security experts of the system. Note that the \\emph{cost of a defense} action ($D_1$) and the cost of attack action ($D_2$) are incorporated in the reward. Thus, solving for an equilibrium of this game results in strategies that account for the cost-reward trade-off. The authors use the notion of a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE).\\footnote{In sequential games, a strategy profile is an SPE if it is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the original game .}\nIn  and , the defender played a predefined strategy that is either uniform random (choose $k$ random vIPs at random) or based on intuitive heuristics (select top-k scanned vIPs). The latter is based on the assumption that the most scanned vIPs will not be scanned as frequently in the new state. The chosen vIPs are then assigned to the $k$ hosts using a purely random matching function. \nIn , the authors explain the game modeling based on a real-world example and compare the effectiveness of a reactive switching strategy to the Uniform Random Strategy (URS). URS, which is found to be more effective, picks all pure strategies $a \\in A^\\mathcal{D}$ with equal probability |$1/A^\\mathcal{D}|$. An array of works that simply use URS as the defender's policy are . This makes an implicit assumption that the game is a constant sum and the normal form game matrix has symmetric rewards. When no information is available about the attacks and the defender has no preference over the MTD configurations, this may be a reasonable assumption. Fortunately, defenders often have an idea about an attacker's threat model and thus, such assumptions (resulting in URS) result in highly sub-optimal movement strategies.\nWorks such as  closely mirror URS strategies but make a minute modification-- given the present deployed OS configuration $c$, they consider a URS over remaining OS configurations, i.e. $C \\setminus \\{c\\}$ as the movement function $M$. In , given all networking paths from source to destination, one is picked at random while in , the authors use to Fisher-Yates shuffling to select a transmission schedule at the start of every round.\nIn , and  the authors design a single-stage normal form game. Thus, if the defender chooses to deploy a particular configuration $c \\in A^\\mathcal{D}$ and the attacker chooses a particular exploit $e \\in A^\\mathcal{A}$, then the rewards for the players can be read from the normal-form game matrix. At equilibrium, a mixed strategy over the defender's actions turns out to be the optimal movement policy. Thus, $M$ is a stochastic function based on the mixed strategy, chooses the next configuration at the end of each switching period. In , the authors consider an MTD for the Internet of Things (IoT) and show that Zero-Determinant strategy results in a dominant strategy for the single-stage game.\nIn , the authors assume (1) a zero-sum reward structure, and (2) a threat model in which the attacker is irrational. The opponent model for the attacker is determined based on historical traces of the attacker's response to defense strategies and eventually updates the utilities of the game to reflect the rationality of the attacker. After each update, the resulting Nash equilibrium (NE) is played. In , the authors assume that if the present system is working with the operating system $c$ and the system is made to switch to the operating system $c'$, lower the similarity between $c$ and $c'$, more secure the move action. To model this, the defender's rewards are defined w.r.t. switch actions and, over time, fine-tuned by simulating the behavior of an adversary. Similar to , the NE strategy is chosen to be the defender's policy.\nThe other works assume that an attacker will eventually, with reconnaissance on its side, figure out the mixed strategy of the defender (using maximum likelihood estimates). Thus, authors of  concentrate on finding the Strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) strategy for the defender. The rewards for their game follow a general-sum structure and are obtained using the CVSS metrics of known attacks that can successfully exploit one of the defender's actions, i.e. the MTD configurations that can be deployed. On similar lines, authors in  use the notion of SE to obtain defender's strategy to thwart DDoS attacks.", "cites": [6797], "cite_extract_rate": 0.06666666666666667, "origin_cites_number": 15, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.2, "critical": 3.5, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes multiple works into a coherent narrative on single-stage game modeling in MTD.

Then they find a meaningful defender strategy over them by ensuring that in a repeated game setting, the advantage that an attacker gained by packet flooding attacks (at some stage in the past) is neutralized by reducing their bandwidth to the low state for $1 \\leq x < \\infty$ number of game stages.\nOn similar lines, authors in  consider a repeated game setting and analyze the defender's policy against self-learning attackers. They infer that in their case, the optimal policy converges to the URS. Other works such as  also update their belief about an attacker based on observations drawn from multiple plays of the game. This belief is then used to come up with an optimal strategy for the defender.\nA set of works in MTD leverage the attack graph of an underlying system to better reason about the sequential process of an attack. In , the authors model the problem of network intrusion via a Bayesian Attack Graph. The action set for the attacker $A^\\mathcal{A}$ includes the (probabilistic) paths an attacker can take in this graph. Then, the authors map these paths with the defender's imperfect sensing capabilities to form a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)~. Thus, the state and transition of this POMDP are designed to model the attacker's behavior and the optimal policy becomes the defender's strategy in a particular belief state. A shortcoming of this work is that this strategy may be sub-optimal if the \\emph{attacker} deviates away (intentionally or not) from the assumptions that informs the POMDP modeling. On the other hand, modeling the scenario as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG)~ results in scalability concerns for any real-world system.\nAuthors in , and  relax the assumption about partial observability and formalize MTD in a Markov Game framework. In , authors consider policies over the defender's action set that comprises of either single or multiple IP hops. Each action results in the defender uniformly selecting the next state given that an attacker samples actions randomly from $A^\\mathcal{A}$. They can show that multi-element IP hopping actions increase the defender's reward by a greater magnitude compared to static defense strategies. As we will discuss later, the authors do not model the cost of performing a hop action or the downtime associated with switches in the defender's reward function. Thus, the optimal defender policy might be sub-optimal for performance in real-world multi-layered network attack scenarios.\nIn contrast, the works  incorporate this trade-off in the rewards ($R^\\mathcal{D}$ and $R^\\mathcal{A}$) of the Markov Game, and can thus generate policies for the defender that trade-off security corresponding to an attacker's actions and performance at each step of the game. In , the inclusion of time variables and attack strategies in the state allows it to formulate the problem as an MDP but, becomes vulnerable when an attacker is aware of this modeling. It also makes it less scalable for large networks. In all these works, the impact on performance $C^\\mathcal{D}$ is a part of $R^\\mathcal{D}$ and often, just a \\emph{heuristic idea} as opposed to simulation in a real system that informs these values. The more accurate these measures become, the better is the strategy.\nAuthors in  model the performance and security concerns in a different way than the above methods. The performance cost represents the switching cost while the rewards of the state represent the security costs of deploying a particular configuration. Then, they formulate an optimization problem that produces a defender strategy that reduces the cost of switching over two steps (one switch) and maximizes the security over a single step. Although the authors in  do not discuss how sub-optimal their switching strategies are, recent work by  extends their approach to a Markov Game setting with the Stackelberg Equilibrium concept.\nLastly, authors in  look at an MTD defense mechanism for deception (obfuscation of the links to send attacker to decoy nodes) and model attackers who are actively trying to uncover this deception over a repeated stage interaction. For one problem, they use the Nash equilibrium (NE) while for the other (identifying decoy nodes) they consider the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) as the defender's strategy. We believe that it is necessary to highlight a shortcoming of the different modeling choices, especially in light of multi-stage attacks and APT scenarios, however optimizing the model and ensuring the scalability is a difficult task, thus we highlight these as possible research opportunities in the Section~\\ref{research}.", "cites": [6792, 6798, 6799], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2, "origin_cites_number": 15, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.2, "critical": 4.0, "abstraction": 3.8}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section demonstrates strong synthesis by connecting various works on multi-stage MTD modeling and identifying common themes, such as the use of game-theoretic and decision-theoretic models.

Jafarian \\textit{et al.}~ propose OpenFlow enabled MTD architecture as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:7}, can be used to mutate IP address with a high degree of unpredictability while keeping a stable network configuration and minimal operational overhead.\nThe mutated IP address is transparent to the end host. The actual IP address of the host called real IP (rIP), which is kept unchanged, but it is linked with a short-lived virtual IP address (vIP) at regular interval. The vIP is translated before the host. The translation of rIP-vIP happens at the gateway of the network, and a centralized SDN controller performs the mutation across the network. A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is formulated in order to maintain mutation rate and unpredictability constraints. The CSP is solved using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver.\nSensitive hosts have a higher mutation rate compared to the regular hosts in this scheme. The OF-RHM is implemented using Mininet network simulator and NOX SDN controller. OF-RHM is able to thwart about 99\\% of information gathering and external scanning attempts. The framework is also highly effective against worms and zero-day exploits.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[\n            state/.style={rectangle},\n            node distance=2.3cm,\n            ]\n            \\centering\n            \\node[state] (controller) [text width=1.3cm, align=center] {{\\Huge \\faServer}\\\\{\\footnotesize Open-flow Controller}};\n            \\node[state] (attacker) [above left of=controller, xshift=-0.5cm, text width=1.2cm, align=center] {{\\Huge \\faUserSecret}\\\\{\\footnotesize Attacker}};\n            \\node[state] (user) [below left of=controller, xshift=-0.5cm, text width=1cm, align=center] {{\\Huge \\faUser}\\\\{\\footnotesize User}};\n            \\node[state] (auth) [above of=controller, yshift=-0.1cm, text width=1.5cm, align=center] {{\\Huge \\faSignIn}\\\\{\\footnotesize Auth Server}};\n            \\node[state] (cloud) [right of=controller, text width=1.5cm, align=center] {{\\Huge \\faCloud}\\\\{\\footnotesize Cloud env.}};\n             \\node[state] (mig) [below right of=cloud, xshift=1cm, text width=1.7cm, align=center] {{\\Huge \\faFilesO}\\\\{\\footnotesize Migration Destination VM}};\n             \\node[state] (target) [above right of=cloud, xshift=1cm, text width=1.7cm, align=center] {{\\Huge \\faFilesO}\\\\{\\footnotesize Target Application VM}};\n            \\path[BrickRed, ->, dashed]\n                (attacker) edge (controller)\n                (controller) edge (cloud)\n                (cloud) edge (mig);\n            \\path[ForestGreen, ->]\n                (user) edge (controller)\n                (controller.-23) edge (cloud.200)\n                (cloud) edge (target);\n            \\path[black, <->, dotted]\n                (auth) edge (controller)\n                (controller.23) edge (cloud.160);\n            \\path[black, ->, dotted]\n                (cloud.50) edge (target.195)\n                (target) edge (mig);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\caption{Virtual Machine migration using frequency minimal MTD seeks to migrate applications to new VMs and redirect an attacker's DDoS attacks without effecting availability to regular users.

The scenario is represented as an extensive-form game spanning multiple rounds. If the node sending network traffic P2, the Defect - Figure~\\ref{fig:case-study3} (b), the normal bandwidth B is reduced to $\\frac{B}{2}$. The bandwidth is reduced in each subsequent round by network admin P1, till average bandwidth over a period of time $t=\\{0,1,2,..\\} \\in T$ is B.\nThe SDN controller utilizes Instruction field present inside the flow table in order to change the band rate of the node flagged as malicious, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:case-study3} (c).

The design goals of this research work are as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Identification of optimal frequency of VM migration, ensuring minimal wastage of cloud resources.\n    \\item Finding the preferred location of VM migration without impacting the application performance. \n\\end{enumerate}\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:8}, the normal clients can access the services hosted in the cloud network via regular path, and the attack path represents the path along which the attacker tries to exploit the target application. The VMs periodically share their resource information such as storage and compute capacity with the controller along the control path. Depending upon the level of threat, the migration of VM can be proactive or reactive. The real IP address of the VM hosting cloud application is hidden from the clients. The data-path shows the path along which VM application and its back-end database are migrated. VM migration is based on the following factors:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{VM Capacity:} This parameter considers the capacity of migration target in terms of computing resources available to store files and database of current and future clients.\n    \\item \\textbf{Network Bandwidth:} The lower the network bandwidth between the source and target VM, the slower will be the migration process and the longer will be the exposure period (in case of active attacks) for the VM being migrated. This parameter considers bandwidth between source and target while performing VM migration.\n    \\item \\textbf{VM Reputation:} This is the objective indicator of VM robustness to deter future cyber attacks. It is the history of VM in terms of cyber attacks launched against the VM. This parameter is considered in order to ensure VM’s suitability for migration.\n\\end{itemize}\nThis research work estimates the optimal migration frequency and ideal migration location based on the parameters described above.

The \\emph{Situation-Aware MTD} model captures different \\emph{security} constraints, attack information and helps in implementation of \\emph{effective} MTD decision which are missing in current research works, discussed in Table~\\ref{tab:6}. The phases are continuous in nature, allowing necessary fine-tuning of MTD parameters at different layers of SDN infrastructure. The five phases can be described as follows:\n\\begin{figure}[!htp]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figures/figure9.pdf}\n    \\caption{SDN/NFV-based Moving Target Defense (MTD) Lifecycle}\n    \\label{fig:9}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item {\\textbf{Vulnerability and Security Policy Analysis:}} This phase of a situation-aware MTD framework involves checking of current system vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools such as Nessus~ or OpenVAS~. Additionally, we enumerate the security policies defined by different security tools such as Snort IDS/IPS~, packet filtering firewall, Deep-packet inspection tools such as nDPI~, {\\em etc.} This phase helps in creating a model of the attack surface, the current privilege level and the current information view of the attacker about the target environment.\n    \\item {\\textbf{Attack Representation:}}\n    The tools utilized for vulnerability analysis often have incomprehensible output. Even for a small network, the vulnerability report can span across hundreds of pages. This makes the security investment decision very difficult. Therefore the attack representation methods such as attack graphs and trees become quite useful. SDN-infrastructure can help in network decomposition using logical network segmentation. The attack graph generation in a segmented network can speed up the attack analysis and MTD decision. \n    \\item {\\textbf{Risk Analysis:}}\n    During this stage of the MTD lifecycle, the network controller can collect statistics from different network interfaces and endpoints. SDN-based attack graph analyzer as proposed by Chung \\textit{et al.}~, can be used for alert correlation from different network segments and creating a risk profile of different virtual machines in the network. Intelligent cyber-deception techniques such as game theoretic analysis based on attack graphs as discussed by Nguyen \\textit{et al.}~, can be used for analyzing risk associated with different MTD candidate countermeasures.\n    \\item {\\textbf{Countermeasure Selection:}}\n    In this stage of SDN-based MTD lifecycle, the countermeasure analysis is performed by the security administrator. The risk profile for a certain VM in the network can be used for performing cost-intrusiveness analysis when selecting a particular countermeasure. The cyber quantification metrics such as Return-of-Investment (ROI) as discussed by Chung \\textit{et al.}~ helps the SDN controller in selection of appropriate MTD countermeasure, e.g. \\textit{network reconfiguration}, \\textit{IDS placement}~, \\textit{VM migration}, {\\em etc.} \n    \\item {\\textbf{Network Status Analysis:}}\n    The MTD lifecycle is a continuous process and deployment. Any SDN countermeasure should not impact network performance. The cost of countermeasures such as service availability, network downtime, as noted by El. Mir. \\textit{et al.}~ should be given sufficient consideration as a part of MTD ecosystem. The MTD decisions, especially at the network-level (route randomization, network reconfiguration) can introduce security policy conflicts, as discussed by Pisharody \\textit{et al.}~.

These works are able to come up with an intelligent movement strategy $M$ based on reasoning over known vulnerabilities (more specifically, common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE)) for which CVSS scores are readily available.

In , the authors try to model zero-day attacks by asking security experts to annotate how effective they think a particular {countermeasure} or defense action will be against zero-day vulnerabilities. As the annotations might be inaccurate (due to the lack of actual black-hat hackers who invent zero-day attacks in the set of security experts who annotate the defense methods), the effectiveness of their MTD cannot be accurately determined.

On a different note, researchers in  try to select a defense configuration from the ensemble based on how diverse it is with respect to the current configuration that might have been attacked.

Jafarian \\textit{et al.}~ identify the {virtual IP} (vIP) {mutation}, {range allocation}, and {range distribution} constraints in order to minimize the QoS impact which can be induced by {vIP} collisions, as well as, maintain optimal-level of unpredictability.\nProbabilistic performance analysis of MTD reconnaissance defenses has been conducted by Crouse \\textit{et al.}~. The research work analyzes quantifiable MTD metrics such as {reconnaissance, deception} performance, \\emph{attack success probability} vs \\emph{connection drop probability}, attacker's success probability under different conditions such as {network-size}, {number of vulnerable computers}. \nTaylor et al. in~ use mission and attack metrics for analyzing the effectiveness of a network defense. The research work analyzes dynamic defenses such as {\\em Active Re-positioning in Cyberspace for Synchronized Evasion} (ARCSYNE) and {\\em Self-shielding Dynamic Network Architecture} (SDNA) using mission and adversary activity set. Mission \\emph{Success}, i.e., the rate at which mission tasks are completed, and Mission \\emph{Productivity}, i.e., how often are mission tasks successful are used as {QoS} measurement metrics are used for evaluations.\nA statistical analysis of static {\\em vs.} dynamic attacks against different MTD strategies-- uniform, random, diversity-based, evolution-based, and optimal-- has been conducted by Carter \\textit{et al.}~. Experimental results on performance {\\em vs.} adaptability shows that diversity-based MTD is the optimal strategy against most attack scenarios. They also show that uncertainty about the adversary type-- slow adversary or fast-evolving adversary-- can adversely impact the effectiveness of an MTD.\nEl-Mir~ models {performance parameters} such as {availability}, {downtime}, and {downtime cost} using a {Continuous Time Markov Chain} (CTMC) model. The experimental results showed that cost-effective {VM migration} can be performed in an SDN-based network with {limited impact} on {network performance}. The research work utilizes normalized CVSS score as a key metric for initiating VM migration. \nSengupta \\textit{et al.}~ analyze the performance impact of placing IDS (NIDS and HIDS) at all possible enforcement points in a cloud network. It is noteworthy that the placement of more than $15$ detection agents in their simulated network fails to provide any additional intrusion detection benefit, whereas the network throughput decreases drastically from $16$ Gbps in the case of a single detection agent to $\\sim 6$ Gbps when $15$ detection agents are placed. \nCHAOS~ analyzes how the delay intentionally introduced by MTD impacts the packet count in a SDN-managed network. The SDN controller utilizes host-mutation and {decoy-severs} to deceive an adversary. The obfuscated network increases the {cost} and {difficulty} for an adversary targeting the network. The percentage of {information disclosure} reduces from $90\\%$ to $10\\%$ in a CHAOS protected network, with slight impact on packet delay ($1$s to $1.5$s for $1800$ packets). \n\\textbf{Cost Metrics:} Protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is one of the important priorities for many cyber systems. Wang \\textit{et al.}  present a cost-effective MTD solution against DDoS and {\\em Covert Channel} attacks. Through MTD adaptation, their work  aims to answer two main questions: 1) what is the adaptation cost?, and 2) what is the cost incurred by a defender if an attacker succeeds in exploiting a particular vulnerability?. This solution does not rely on IDS-generated alerts while making the adaptation. The adaptation cost includes any cost related to purchasing required software or hardware that helps in the adaptation process. Lei \\textit{et al.}~ utilize change-point analysis method for evaluation MTD cost-benefit for a multi-layer network resource graph. The proposed method analyzes mission productivity ($\\Delta M$), and attack success productivity ($\\Delta A$) on dynamic network address translation (DNAT). The evaluation results show reduced attack success probability using DNAT over a network under observation. The path enumeration mechanism used in this research work can, however, suffers from scalability challenges because of frequent path probability calculation and update operations. The cost and effectiveness evaluation of reactive and proactive network defense strategies, has been conducted by Taylor \\emph{et al.}~ using Measurement of Effectiveness (MOE) metrics. The research work considers hop-delay for different attack success rates, and static defense policies. They show that an attacker's productivity, i.e., how quickly attacker can perform adversarial tasks increases against static defense, whereas attacker's confidentiality, i.e., ability to remain undetected is same for both the static and the dynamic defense case. \n\\iffalse\nThe measurement of cyber risk using experience and vulnerability assessment tools based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)~ is not enough.", "cites": [6795], "cite_extract_rate": 0.1, "origin_cites_number": 10, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section integrates several papers to discuss MTD effectiveness from a usability and cost perspective, connecting themes like QoS impact, cost of adaptation, and attacker behavior.

Investigation in this area would require one to identify sets of configurations across the various surfaces that are compatible (in terms of performance) with one another. This prevents the number of strategies from multiplying uncontrollably by leveraging the expertise of system designers.\nThe categorization of the various software surfaces opens up the possibility of considering other logical surface level distinctions and thus, MTDs that shift these surfaces.

In such cases, a game-theoretic modeling can result in better strategies that offer higher gains in terms of both security and performance metrics. Unfortunately, the latter works suffer from scalability issues, encouraging practitioners to default to URS. Works that can leverage existing knowledge without suffering from scalability issues can fill an important gap in MTD research.\nRecently, it has been shown that attacks on networks are better characterized by persistent approaches such as APTs. In such scenarios, attackers are known to demonstrate sequential attack behavior spread over a long time.\nA relatively new line of work investigates modeling MTDs to come up with strategies that are effective against APTs. Although these approaches leverage the use of attack graphs to bootstrap the modeling process , they do not scale well. While real-world cloud services host thousands of nodes, researchers have only considered small-scale settings .
