As a result, it has been widely used in different application areas such as affect analysis~, sport science~, health~, and user identification~. Gait information can be captured using a number of sensing modalities such as wearable sensors attached to the human body, for instance accelerometers, gyroscopes, and force and pressure sensors~. Non-wearable gait recognition systems predominantly use vision, and are therefore mostly known as vision-based gait recognition. These systems capture gait data using imaging sensors with no cooperation from the subjects and even from far away distances~. The focus of this paper is to survey vision-based gait recognition systems that have mainly relied on deep learning. We focus solely on vision-based gait recognition as a comprehensive review paper has recently been published, surveying wearable-based gait recognition approaches~.\nThe performance of vision-based gait recognition systems, hereafter only referred to only as gait recognition, can be affected by \\textit{i)} variations in the appearance of the individual, such as carrying a handbag/backpack or wearing items of clothing such as a hat or a coat; \\textit{ii)} variations in the camera viewpoint; \\textit{iii)} occlusion factors, for instance where parts of the subject's body are partially covered by an object or by a part of the subject's own body in certain viewpoints (known as self-occlusion)~; and \\textit{iv)} variations in the environment, such as complex backgrounds~ and high or low levels of lighting~, which generally make the segmentation and recognition processes more difficult.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{Images/fig1_v2.pdf}\n\\caption{The number of gait recognition papers published after 2015 using non-deep ({orange}) and deep ({blue}) gait recognition methods.

From a `biometrics' perspective, gait recognition has several unique characteristics that distinguishes it from other biometric modalities. For instance, in contrast to many other biometric systems such as face~, ear~, iris, and fingerprint~ recognition that require subjects to be quite close to acquisition systems, gait data can be captured from far away distances~. As a result, gait recognition videos may often be recorded with low spatial resolution, hence many details regarding the scene become challenging to detect by automated systems. Moreover, while most biometric recognition systems need the subjects’ active cooperation towards acquisition, gait recognition data can be captured in a discrete manner~. As a result, the likelihood of recording gait patterns in an uncontrolled and non-obscured manner considerably increases. Interestingly, this very property makes gait difficult to forge by imposters, making it reliable for sensitive applications such as crime analysis~.\nWhat makes some of the challenges in gait recognition unique and distinct from general `computer vision' problems is that most gait recognition methods learn representations from analysis of the \\textit{skeletons} or \\textit{silhouettes} of subjects. Meanwhile, other visual classification problems often heavily rely on derived features from \\textit{texture} in addition to shape and structure information. \nFor example, despite the similarities of computer vision problems such as `person re-identification'~ and `human activity recognition'~ to gait recognition, gait data still pose challenges and properties that are unique to this field. \nSpecifically, person re-identification methods identify subjects across multiple non-overlapping surveillance cameras, or possibly from the same camera but at different time instances. To this end, these methods aim to learn representations that capture appearance characteristics of individuals such as clothing and skin color tone, that are shared across multiple cameras~. On the contrary, gait recognition methods aim to learn suitable representations with which \\textit{walking patterns} can be disentangled from the visual appearance of the subjects and subsequently used for classification~.\nWhen comparing gait recognition to human activity recognition methods~, the goal of the latter is to identify specific movements or actions of a subject from video clips, which can be considered as `macro' motion patterns. Meanwhile, gait characteristics can be considered nuanced `micro' patterns that sit on top of a specific activity class, namely \\textit{walking}. As a result, the detection of such subtle discriminative information are often more challenging than those dealt with for activity recognition. Furthermore, given the subtlety of gait patterns that make them unique to different subjects, they can often be highly influenced by the temporary personal state of the subject, for instance, fatigue~, excitement and fear~, and even injuries~.", "cites": [289, 290, 293, 288, 292, 291], "cite_extract_rate": 0.42857142857142855, "origin_cites_number": 14, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes information from multiple biometric recognition papers to highlight the unique characteristics of gait recognition, such as the ability to work at a distance and the reliance on micro-patterns rather than texture.

It is observed that the majority of gait recognition methods in 2019 and 2020 have been designed based on deep neural networks. In Figure \\ref{fig:timeline}, we illustrate the evolution of some of the most important gait recognition methods along with their associated accuracy on the CASIA-B~ (perhaps the most popular dataset for gait recognition) when available. The first gait recognition method was proposed in 1997~, followed by the first shallow neural network for gait recognition in 2008~, consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. In 2015, the field witnessed significant breakthroughs, notably due to the popularization of deep neural networks~. The method entitled GaitNet~ was then proposed in 2016 based on a 6-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). In 2017, DBNGait~ was proposed based on a deep belief network (DBN), and in~ three different deep CNN architectures with different depths and architectures were fused for gait recognition. VGR-Net~ was one of the important contributions in 2018, followed by the introduction of several significant methods in 2019, including PoseGait~, DisentangledGait~, and GaitSet~, where the best recognition accuracy of 84.2\\% was achieved by GaitSet~.

Silhouette is the most frequently used body representation in the literature that can be easily computed by subtracting each image containing the subject from its background, followed by binarization. Gait silhouettes are proven to be effective and convenient for describing the body state in a single frame with low computational cost. This body representation forces recognition solutions to focus on `gait' as opposed to clothing and other non-gait factors that could, from the perspective of a classifier, be used for identification.\nA sequence of silhouettes can represent useful gait features such as speed, cadence, leg angles, gait cycle time, step length, stride length, and the the ratio between swing and stance phases~. It can also be processed to extract motion data, for example using optical flow calculation~.

Two types of representations, \\textit{templates} and \\textit{volumes}, have been commonly used in the literature. Following we describe these representations.\nTemplates aggregate temporal walking information over a sequence of silhouettes in a single map, for example by averaging the silhouettes over at least one gait cycle. This operation enables recognition solutions to be independent of the number of frames once template maps have been created. With respect to deep gait recognition architectures, gait silhouettes can be aggregated in the initial layer of a network (Figure \\ref{fig:template_Layer}-a), also known as \\textit{temporal templates}, where the aggregated map can then be processed by subsequent layers~. Gait silhouettes can alternatively be aggregated in an intermediate layer of the network after several convolution and pooling layers (Figure \\ref{fig:template_Layer}-b), also known as \\textit{convolutional template}~. \nExamples of temporal templates include: (\\textit{i}) gait energy images (GEI)~, which average gait silhouettes over one period/sequence (Figure \\ref{fig:template_Layer}-c); (\\textit{ii}) chrono gait images (CGI)~, which extract the contour in each gait image to be then encoded using a multi-channel mapping function in the form a single map (Figure \\ref{fig:template_Layer}-d); (\\textit{iii}) frame-difference energy images (FDEI)~, which preserve the kinetic information using clustering and denoising algorithms, notably when the silhouettes are incomplete (Figure \\ref{fig:template_Layer}-e); (\\textit{iv}) gait entropy images (GEnI)~, computing entropy for each pixel in the gait frames to be then averaged in a single gait template (Figure \\ref{fig:template_Layer}-f); and (\\textit{v}) period energy images (PEI)~, a generalization of GEI that preserves more spatial and temporal information by exploiting a multi-channel mapping function based on the amplitudes of frames (Figure \\ref{fig:template_Layer}-g). Examples of convolutional templates include set pooling~ and gait convolutional energy maps (GCEM)~, which average convolutional maps obtained by several convolution and pooling layers, over the whole sequence. \nTo preserve and learn from the order and relationship of frames in gait sequences, instead of aggregating them, sequence volume representations have be adopted (see Figure~\\ref{fig:taxonomy}, second box from the left). Then, to learn the temporal information, two different approaches have been adopted. In the first approach, the temporal dynamics over the sequences are learned using recurrent learning strategies, for example recurrent neural networks, where each frame is processed with respect to its relationships with the previous frames~.

Convolutional layers convolve learned filters with the input image to create activation feature maps that capture features with varying levels of detail. The convolutional layers also include activation functions such as a ReLU~ or a tanh~ functions, to increase the non-linearity in the output. \nPooling layers then reduce the spatial size of the feature maps by using nonlinear down-sampling strategies, such as average or maximum pooling, thus decreasing the complexity of the network. Fully connected layers are finally used to learn the resulting 2D feature maps into 1D vectors for further processing.\nTo better analyze CNNs adopted in the state-of-the-art gait recognition methods, we provide an overview of the most successful used architectures in Table \\ref{tab:CNN}.

This is contrary to many other domains, such as face or activity recognition, where very deep networks such as ResNet~ and inception~ are used to learn highly discriminative features.} In Table \\ref{tab:CNN}, we also present the size of CNN inputs, showing a trend toward a 64$\\times$64 resolution in the recent literature. Additionally, an analysis in~ showed that the resolutions of 64$\\times$64 and 128$\\times$128 lead to the best gait recognition results for several tested CNNs, where the input resolution of 128$\\times$128 works slightly better than 64$\\times$64.

A layer of RNN is typically composed of several cells, each corresponding to one input element of the sequence, e.g., one frame of a gait video. RNNs can also stacks several layers to make the model deeper, where the output of the $i^{th}$ cell in $j^{th}$ layer feeds the $i^{th}$ cell in the $(j+1)^{th}$ layer. Each cell is connected to its previous and subsequent cells, thus memorizing information from the previous time steps~. Among different RNN architectures, LSTM~ and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)~ are the most widely used RNN architectures that have been used to learn the relationships available in a gait sequence using memory states and learnable gating functions. In an LSTM network~, the cells have a common cell state, which keeps long-term dependencies along the entire LSTM cell chain, controlled by two gates, the so-called input and forget gates, thus allowing the network to decide when to forget the previous state or update the current state with new information. The output of each cell, the hidden state, is controlled by an output gate that allows the cell to compute its output given the updated cell state. GRU~ is another form of RNN that does not use output activation functions as opposed to LSTM. This architecture also includes an update gate that allows the network to update the current state with respect to the new information. The output of the gate, also known as the reset gate, only maintains connections with the cell input.\n{There have been three different approaches to use RNNs for gait recognition systems. The first approach~ (Figure \\ref{fig:taxonomy}-a) that has been mostly adopted for skeleton representations, uses RNNs in order to learn from temporal relationships of joint positions. In the second approach~ (Figure \\ref{fig:taxonomy}-b), as will be discussed later in detail in Section \\ref{sec:hib}, RNNs are combined with other types of the neural architectures, notably CNNs, for learning both spatial and temporal information.

In turn, the discriminator aims to distinguish between the fake and real samples. As a result of this minimax game between these two components, GANs can generate realistic synthesized samples. {In the context of gait recognition, GANs can be used to solve the problem of gait variations due to clothing, viewpoints, and carrying conditions. For instance, GANs can transform gait data from one view to another, or change the type of clothing worn by the subject, or even remove a backpack that was originally carried by the subject.\nSuch disentanglement of identity from confounding factors often results in improvements in the performance of gait recognition systems~. Nevertheless, one of the most important challenges toward manipulating gait data is the preservation of human identity features while modifying appearance characteristics in the representation space. To this end, two discriminators are often used~. The first discriminator is used to distinguish real vs. fake samples in order to ensure that the generated images appear realistic. The second discriminator is exploited to ensure that identity information are preserved by taking a pair of source and target images as input and producing a scalar probability of whether the input pair belongs to the same person or not.}\nDifferent types of GANs have recently been adopted for gait recognition. Multi-task GAN (MGANs)~ have been proposed for cross-view gait recognition, where a CNN is used to learn the temporal template as view-specific features in a latent space. Then, the features are transformed from one view to another using a view transform layer. The network is then trained with multi-task adversarial and pixel-wise losses.

Among these, architectures with CNN+RNN, DAE+GAN, DAE+RNN, and RNN+CapsNet components are the most popular in the deep gait recognition literature (see Figure \\ref{fig:taxonomy}). Following we provide the descriptions and examples of these four hybrid architectures.\n\\textbf{CNN+RNN.} Integration of CNNs with RNNs (notably LSTM and GRU) for learning the temporal relationships following spatial encoding is perhaps the most popular approach for spatio-temporal learning, which has also been used for gait recognition in the literature. \nIn~, a deep gait recognition system was proposed by combining eight different CNN architectures with LSTM to obtain spatio-temporal features from image sequences. The proposed method in~ first divides gait silhouettes into 4 horizontal parts, where each part was fed to an individual CNN with 10 layers. An attention-based LSTM was then used to output frame-level attention scores for each sequence of CNN features. The CNN features were finally multiplied by their corresponding weights to selectively focus on the most important frames for gait recognition. In~, convolutional maps from gait frames were first learned using an 8-layer CNN. The convolutional maps were then aggregated to form GCEM templates which were then split into horizontal bins. These partial features (horizontal bins) were finally learned by an attentive bi-directional GRU to exploit the relations between these parts of the embedding.\n\\textbf{DAE+GAN.} Recently, DAEs have been considered as the backbone of the generator and/or discriminator components in GANs for gait recognition~. GaitGAN~ and GaitGANv2~ used two discriminators with encoder-decoder structures, respectively for fake/real discrimination and identification. These two discriminators ensured that the generated gait images were realistic and that the generated images contained identity information. The Alpha-blending GAN (Ab-GAN) proposed in~ exploits an encoder-decoder network as the generator to generate gait templates without carried objects. Cycle-consistent Attentive GAN (CA-GAN) was proposed in~ and used an encoder-decoder structure for gait view synthesis. The proposed GAN contains two branches to simultaneously exploit both global and partial feature representations. \n\\textbf{DAE+RNNs.} \nThe combination of DAEs and RNNs has recently been proposed for generating sequence-based disentangled features using an LSTM RNN~. In this context, a deep encoder-decoder network with novel loss functions was first used to disentangle gait features, namely identity information from appearance and canonical features that mostly contain spurious information for gait recognition. A multi-layer LSTM was then used to capture temporal dynamics of the gait features to be finally aggregated for the recognition purpose~. \n\\textbf{RNNs+CapsNets.} Recurrently learned features obtained by RNNs can be treated as capsules~, thus learning coupling weights between these capsules through dynamic routing. This encapsulated hierarchical part-whole relationships between the recurrently learned features that can make the hybrid network more robust against appearance and view changes. Additionally, the CapsNet can act as an attention mechanism, thus assigning more importance to the more relevant features. In~, a CapsNet was used to treat the recurrently learned partial representations of a convolution template as capsules, thus learning the coupling weights between the partial features. This led to exploiting the relationships between the partial features while also preserving positional attributes. So, the model could generalize better to unseen gait viewpoints during testing. In ~, a capsule network with dynamic routing was used to exploit the spatial and structural relations between body parts. In this context, the recurrently learned features were first extracted using an LSTM network from a sequence of gait frames to feed the capsule network.\n\\begin{table*}[]\n\\centering\n\\setlength\\tabcolsep{1.80pt}\n\\caption{Classification of deep gait recognition methods based on our proposed taxonomy.}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l}\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Ref.} &\\textbf{Year} & \\textbf{Venue}         & \\textbf{Body Rep.}                 & \\textbf{Temporal Rep.}     & \\textbf{Feat.

Following are the key ideas from the analysis.\n\\textbf{Body Representation.} Silhouettes are the most widely adopted body representation for deep gait recognition, corresponding to over 81\\% of the literature. Skeletons have been considered less frequently compared to silhouettes, corresponding to only 13\\% of the available solutions. There have also been a few methods, i.e., approximately 5\\% of the available literature, that exploit both skeleton and silhouette representations, notably using disentangled representation learning or fusion strategies. Based on our analysis,\nhigh performing gait recognition methods such as~ have all adopted silhouette body representation. Nonetheless, due to recent advancements in effective pose-estimation techniques~ capable of extracting accurate and robust skeleton data from videos, we anticipate methods based on hybrid silhouettes-skeleton body representations to gain popularity in the near future.\n\\textbf{Temporal Representation.} Gait templates have been the most considered representation for capturing temporal gait information, corresponding to 70\\% of the proposed deep methods. Among different types of gait templates, GEI and set-pooling have been adopted the most. Around 30\\% of solutions adopt sequence volumes to preserve the order of available gait frames and to learn from their relationships. Given the frequent use of convolutional templates in some of the recent high-performing literature~, we anticipate that these templates gain further popularity and surpass temporal templates in the future.\n\\textbf{Feature Representation.} Our analysis shows that over 87\\% of available methods are based on global feature representations, where deep features are learned by considering gait information as a whole. Recently, many interesting and high performing methods~ have adopted partial representations by splitting the gait data into local regions. The performance of such techniques points to promising potential in partial representation learning for discriminating key gait features. Hence, we anticipate further research with convincing results in this area. \n\\textbf{Neural Architectures.}  As presented in Figure~\\ref{fig:tax}(b), 2D CNNs are the most widely used DNN type for deep gait recognition with 48\\% of the published solutions utilizing only 2D CNN architectures for classification. \n3D CNNs and GANs are the next popular categories, each corresponding to 8\\% of the literature. DAEs, RNNs, CapsNets, DBNs, and GCNs are less considered among DNNs, respectively corresponding to 4\\%, 2\\%, 2\\%, 1\\%, and 1\\% of the methods. Concerning hybrid methods which constitute 26\\% of the published solutions, CNN-RNN combinations are the most widely adapted approach with 16\\% share,\nwhile the combination of DAEs with GANs and RNNs corresponds to 8\\% of the methods, followed by RNN-CapsNet methods that make up 2\\% of the solutions. We expect that hybrid methods that make use of two or more types of DNN attract more attention in the near future and demonstrate robust performance in the field.\n\\textbf{Loss Functions.}\nLoss functions calculate a model's error during training and should ideally be designed to efficiently capture the properties of the problem for facilitating an effective training process~. Figure~\\ref{fig:tax}(b) shows the usage frequency of different well-known loss functions that have been used by deep gait recognition literature. Among the single loss functions, cross-entropy~ has been the most widely adopted with 20\\% of solutions having used it. This loss function takes the output probabilities of the predicated classes\nand makes the model output as close as possible to the ground-truth output. Triplet loss~ is the next popular type with a usage frequency of 17\\%. This loss has been notably used by some of the most recent and state-of-the-art solutions~ and ~. This loss function compares a baseline input, also known as \\textit{anchor}, to a \\textit{positive} sample with the same identity, and a \\textit{negative} sample with a different identity. The loss function then ensures that the dissimilarity between two feature vectors belonging to the same subject is lower than that between feature vectors belonging to two different subjects. Contrastive loss~ corresponds to 7\\% of the recognition methods, and uses pairs of samples including anchor-neighbor or anchor-distant. If the pair of samples is anchor-neighbor, the loss function minimizes their distance; otherwise, it increases their distance. Th next popular loss function, corresponding to 6\\% of the recognition methods, is based on the softmax loss~. There have also been some other loss functions, such as arcface~, center loss~, and Euclidean loss~ with a combined usage frequency of 9\\% that have been less considered for gait recognition. Finally, there have been two classes of deep gait recognition methods that use multiple loss functions (usage frequency of 41\\%), including (\\textit{i}) methods such as~ that add together two or more loss functions to complement each other and compensate their weaknesses; and (\\textit{ii}) methods that have been designed based on networks with multiple components, such GANs with generators and discriminators~ and hybrid networks~, where different loss functions have been used to train different components. We expect that deep gait recognition methods based on multiple losses attract more attention and surpass other approaches in the near future.\n\\textbf{Datasets.}\nWe tally the number of times each dataset has been used by the published literature and present the results in Figure~\\ref{fig:tax}(b). Figure~\\ref{fig:tax}(b) does not include the datasets that have appeared less than 3 times in Table~\\ref{tab:Status}. In addition, a point to consider is that many of the literature use more than one dataset to perform the experiments. We observe that CASIA-B~ is the most widely used dataset, appearing in 80\\% of the published literature, as it provides a large number of samples with variations in carrying and wearing conditions. OU-ISIR~ was the largest gait dataset prior to 2018; we therefore found OU-ISIR to be the second most popular dataset having been used by 40\\% of the solutions. Since the introduction of OU-MVLP~ in 2018, this dataset has been receiving considerable attention from the community and has been used by 18\\% of the methods in a span of only 2 years. The OU-ISIR LP Bag dataset~ only consists of gait data with carried objects, so naturally it was only considered when designing solutions for specific applications such as those intended to be invariant to carrying conditions from a single viewpoint. As a result, this dataset was used for evaluation purposes by only 5\\% of methods. TUM GAID~ has also been less considered by the community, corresponding to 5\\% of published literature. Finally, CASIA-E~ which was developed in 2020 is the sixth most widely used, appearing in 4\\% of the literature. However, we anticipate that this dataset will become the standard benchmark dataset for gait recognition in the near future, due to the fact that it provides hundreds of video sequences per each subject with high variations in appearance and acquisition environments.", "cites": [311, 310, 296, 309, 308, 9138, 295, 300, 298], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2571428571428571, "origin_cites_number": 35, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 4.0}, "insight_level": "high", "analysis": "The section effectively synthesizes information from the cited papers into a structured analysis across five dimensions (body, temporal, feature, neural architecture, and loss functions), connecting trends and methodological choices.

Concerning the OU-MVLP dataset, results show the superiority of the method proposed in~ (performance result of 89.18\\%) over other methods. Apart from~ and~, there are several other methods including those proposed in~, whose performances are near the state-of-the-art for these datasets.

However, these attacks are rather hard and limited as they require trained and qualified imitators. Different from the traditional spoofing attacks, \\textit{adversarial attacks} to gait recognition systems have been designed to imperceptibly fool recognition systems by synthesizing input gait videos with both good quantitative similarity and visual realism.}\n{Despite the strong performance of deep learning solutions in computer vision, such solutions have been surprisingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks~. These attacks introduce perturbations in visual content that can manipulate the predictions of deep models by resulting in embeddings capable of fooling the classifiers~. \nSince the introduction of the first adversarial attacks to deep neural networks in 2014~, these models have attracted significant attention from the research community in computer vision and pattern analysis. Among the adversarial attack approaches, GANs~ have been one of the most powerful methods for image and video manipulation.}\n{The first attempt to investigates the vulnerability of gait recognition systems to adversarial attacks was done in~ using a GAN for synthesizing gait images. In this context, the foreground of each frame of the source video is first segmented to be then fed to the generator along with the target background. The generator is composed of two parallel encoder-decoder networks, respectively dealing with foreground and background information. The corresponding feature representations from these two networks are fused at multiple scales. Static and dynamic silhouette-based losses have been designed in order to force the model to generate more realistic results for gait recognition. Additionally, triplet loss is used to preserve the similarity between the individuals in the source and generated videos. The performance of two state-of-the-art gait recognition systems, including CNNGait~ and GaitSet~, were evaluated using the generated gait samples. The results showed that the generated samples provide sufficient discriminative information to bypass gait recognition systems. To show how the sequence-based gait recognition is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, another study was done in~. In this study, a novel temporal sparse adversarial attack method was proposed based on a GAN to synthesize high-quality sequences of silhouette frames. To ensure imperceptibility of the proposed method, a few adversarial gait silhouettes are substituted or inserted in the sequence. Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art GaitSet~ method has low robustness to this adversarial attack.}\n{The presented results in~ suggest that adversarial attacks can surprisingly degrade the performance of deep gait recognition methods, thus posing a real threat to such recognition systems.

In this context, general and rich high-level semantics can be captured without using any annotated labels. Self-supervised approaches can define various pretext tasks, such as body part motion or sequence order recognition for input sequences~, to be solved by a network. Through learning these pretext tasks, the network can then learn generic features. The network trained with the generated pre-text labels can then be fine-tuned with the actual labels in order to recognize the identity. Among self-supervised approaches, contrastive learning methods~, including SimCLR~, are promising approaches that learn representations by defining an \\textit{anchor} and a \\textit{positive} sample in the feature space, and then aim to make the anchor separable from the \\textit{negative} samples. One important challenge in using self-supervised learning in the context of gait recognition is to design effective pretext tasks to ensure the network can learn meaningful representations.\nAdditionally, \njoint learning of several pretext tasks in a network~, instead of a single pretext task, notably using several loss functions~, can provide the network with more representative features~.\nWe expect these challenges to gain increased popularity in the context of deep gait recognition in the near future.", "cites": [321, 7000, 7020, 322, 7019, 320, 7018, 7017], "cite_extract_rate": 0.8888888888888888, "origin_cites_number": 9, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section integrates concepts from multiple papers to highlight the potential and challenges of self-supervised learning in gait recognition.

Similar approaches have been carried out for the more \\textit{privacy-sensitive} area of facial recognition~, where large datasets comprised only of fake data have been developed to be used in deep learning research~. In addition, such approaches can be used to increase the variance of existing datasets. For instance, large-scale gait datasets such as OU-ISIR~ and OU-MVLP~ only provide normal walking sequences with no variations in occlusion or carrying and clothing conditions. Thus, solutions trained on these datasets usually fail to generalize well when facing variations in appearance and environment during the testing phase.
