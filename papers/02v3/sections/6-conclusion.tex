We presented InsightEval, an automated system for evaluating the insightfulness of scientific papers. By decomposing insightfulness into depth, breadth, and height dimensions and grounding evaluation in retrieved evidence from cited references, our system provides transparent and interpretable assessments. Deployment on 200+ papers demonstrates the system's applicability to both human-written and AI-generated content.

Future directions include: (1) extending evaluation beyond introduction sections to full papers; (2) incorporating user feedback to calibrate scoring models; (3) developing lightweight, fine-tuned models for cost-effective deployment; and (4) conducting human evaluation studies to validate alignment with expert judgments.
