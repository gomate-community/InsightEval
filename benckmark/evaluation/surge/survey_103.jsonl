The 5G networks are characterized by three major features with its ability to support Enhanced Mobile Broadband, Massive Machine Type Communication and the provisioning of Ultra-reliable Low Latency Communication services . Driven by the explosion of smart mobile devices and the rapid advances of communication technologies, 5G could be a technical enabler for a plethora of new innovative business opportunities and industrial applications, and facilitates the seamless collaboration across domains by interconnecting billions of devices. The 5G mobile networks promise to revolutionize global industries and provide immediate impacts on customers and business stakeholders. The main vision of future 5G services is to provide a customized and advanced user-centric value, enabling connection of nearly all aspects of the human life to communication networks to meet the ever growing demands of user traffic and emerging services . To achieve these objectives, several underlying wireless technologies have been proposed to enable future 5G networks, including cloud computing, edge computing, Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Network Slicing, and D2D communication . However, the rapid surge and breakneck expansion of 5G wireless services in terms of scale, speed, and capacity also pose new security challenges such as network reliability, data immutability, privacy  that must be considered and solved before wide deployments. \nMany security solutions have been used in the previous generations of communication networks (i.e., 2G, 3G and 4G) [48]. For example, in the physical layer of 2G-4G networks, Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) techniques, combining Forward Error Correction (FEC) channel codes and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) have been used widely, which can detect and rectify wrong data bits in supporting data authentication. Moreover, for detecting errors in data communications, data storage, and data compression, error-detection techniques such as cyclic redundancy check (CRC) have been leveraged in the radio link control (RLC) layer for data reliability guarantees. However, these security techniques and architectures used in the previous generations (2G-4G), apparently, will not suffice for 5G due to the following reasons.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item A critical reason is that the above security techniques used in 2G-4G are powerless to deal with the problem of data tampering, such as deletion, injection, alternation in 5G networks.\n\t\\item Another reason is the dynamics of new technologies and services in 5G networks, which pose new requirements on security and privacy beyond protecting data integrity.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn particular, the emerging 5G technologies such as SDN, NFV, network slicing and D2D communications in 5G will support new service delivery models and thus further exacerbate the security challenges. Unlike the legacy cellular networks, 5G wireless networks are going to be decentralized and ubiquitous service-oriented which have a special emphasis on security and privacy requirements from the perspective of services. In particular, the security management in 5G is more complex due to various types of and a massive number of devices connected. How to provide an open data architecture for flexible spectrum sharing, data sharing, multiuser access, for example, to achieve ubiquitous 5G service provisions while ensuring high data immutability and transparency is a critical issue. Succinctly, the security architectures of the previous generations lack the sophistication needed to secure 5G networks.\nIn the 5G/6G era, immutability, decentralization and transparency are crucial security factors that ensure the successful roll-out of new services such as IoT data collection, driverless cars, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Federated Learning (FL). Among the existing technologies, blockchain is the most promising one to meet these new security requirements and reshape the 5G communication landscape , . Hence, 5G needs blockhain for its wide 5G service deployments.  \nFrom the technical perspective, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that was firstly used to serve as the public digital ledger of cryptocurrency Bitcoin  for economic transactions. The blockchain is basically a decentralized, immutable and transparent database. The concept of blockchain is based on a peer-to-peer network architecture in which transaction information is managed flexibly by all network participants and not controlled by any single centralized authority. In particular, the blockchain technology boasts a few desirable characteristics of decentralization, immutability, accountability, and truly trustless database storage which significantly improve network security and save operational costs . The rapid development and the adoption of blockchain as a disruptive technology are paving the way for the next generation of financial and industrial services.  Currently, blockchain technology has been investigated and applied in various applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT) , , edge computing , smart city , vehicular networks , and industries .\nFor the inherent superior properties, blockchain has the potential to be integrated with the 5G ecosystems to empower mobile networks and services as shown in Fig. 1. Due to the advanced technical capabilities to support future network services, blockchain was regarded as one of the key technical drivers for 6G at the 2018 Mobile World Congress (MWC) . It is also predicted that blockchains would be a key technology in reaping real benefits from 5G networks, for giving birth to novel applications from autonomous resource sharing, ubiquitous computing to reliable content-based storage and intelligent data management . \nThe combination of blockchain and 5G is also expected to pave the way for emerging mobile services . In fact, 5G is all about connecting heterogeneous devices and complex networks interconnecting more than 500 billion mobile devices by 2030 . Besides, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), and Massive Machine Communications (MMC) are predicted to create over 80 billion connections by 2020 . In such a context, the ultra-dense small cell networks, a fundamental component of 5G infrastructure, will provide connections and energy efficiencies of radio links with high data rates and low latencies. However, it introduces trust and secure interoperability concerns among complex sub-networks. Therefore, providing a reliable cooperation among heterogeneous devices is vitally important for 5G mobile networks. In this regard, blockchain with its immutable and decentralized transaction ledgers can enable distributed massive communication with high security and trustworthiness . Moreover, network slicing associated with other emerging technologies such as cloud/ edge computing, SDN, NFV, and D2D communication are also key enablers for future 5G networks and services. A big challenge for current 5G platforms is the need to guarantee an open, transparent, and secure system among the extraordinary number of resources and mobile users. Blockchain with its innovative concepts of decentralized operation can provide a high level of data privacy, security, transparency, immutability for storage of 5G heterogeneous data , . Blockchain is thus expected to be an indispensable tool to fulfill the performance expectations for 5G systems with minimal costs and management overheads. \n\\textit{\\textbf{Related survey works and Contributions:}}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics [height=15.5cm, width=14cm]{Structure.pdf}\n\t\\caption{The structure of the paper.   }\n\t\\vspace{-0.17in}\n\\end{figure*}\nBlockchains have gained momentum in the academia, with a number of surveys published in , , , , , , which have discussed many aspects such as architecture, concepts, technologies and application domains. The 5G systems have also attracted attention , , , . Despite growing interest in blockchain and 5G, the focus of existing survey works is on each of the specific technologies. There have been no surveys that emphasize the integration of blockchain and 5G. The authors in  only provided a brief introduction of the blockchain adoption in secure 5G resource management and reliable network orchestration. The survey in  provided a short survey on the potential of blockchain for 5G networks in Industry 4.0. Similarly, the studies in ,  presented a brief review on the benefits of blockchain for 5G-based industrial IoTs. \nThus, to our best knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey on the integrated use of blockchain and 5G technologies and services.  In this paper, we provide an extensive survey on the integration of blockchain and 5G technologies for providing services, including cloud computing, edge computing, Software Defined Networks, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communication. We also detail the use of blockchain for supporting important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to mitigating interference, federated learning, privacy and security attacks. The potential of blockchain in 5G IoT networks is also discussed through a number of use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. Besides, we highlight the research challenges and open issues, and point out the promising future research directions related to the blockchain-5G integrations.

The core idea of a blockchain is decentralization. This means that blockchain does not store any of its database in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of participants (i.e. computers). Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. This decentralized architecture ensures robust and secure operations on blockchain with the advantages of tamper resistance and no single-point failure vulnerabilities. In particular, blockchain can be accessible for everyone and is not controlled by any network entity. This is enabled by a mechanism called consensus which is a set of rules to ensure the agreement among all participants on the status of the blockchain ledger. The general concept on how blockchain operates is shown in Fig. 3. \nIn general, blockchains can be classified as either a public (permission-less) or a private (permissioned) blockchain . A public blockchain is accessible for everyone and anyone can join and make transactions as well as participate in the consensus process. The best-known public blockchain applications include Bitcoin and Ethereum. Private blockchains on the other hand are an invitation-only network managed by a central entity. A participant has to be permissioned using a validation mechanism. In order to realize the potential of blockchain in 5G networks, it is necessary to understand the operation concept, main properties of blockchain, and understand how blockchain can bring opportunities to 5G applications. In this section, we first present the main components of a blockchain network. Next, we discuss the key characteristics of blockchains in terms of immutability, decentralization, transparency, security and privacy, which can benefit for 5G networks and services.", "cites": [1295], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 2, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.0, "critical": 1.5, "abstraction": 2.0}, "insight_level": "low", "analysis": "The section provides a basic, descriptive overview of blockchain technology and its characteristics, such as decentralization and consensus.

{"id": "e545915a-d9e1-4900-8187-d072fa6e789f", "title": "Main components of blockchain", "level": "subsubsection", "subsections": [], "parent_id": "6baf8df7-12ad-4ae1-89fc-d8db7b49cf7c", "prefix_titles": [["title", "Blockchain for 5G and Beyond Networks: \\\\  A State of the Art Survey"], ["section", "Blockchain and 5G: background, definition and motivation"], ["subsection", "\tBlockchain "], ["subsubsection", "Main components of blockchain"]], "content": "Blochain features several key components which are summarized as the following.\n- \\textit{Data block:} Blockchain is essentially a chain of blocks, a linear structure beginning with a so-called genesis block and continuing with every new block linked to the chain. Each block contains a number of transactions and is linked to its immediately-previous block through a hash label. In this way, all blocks in the chain can be traced back to the previous one, and no modification or alternation to block data is possible. Specially, a typical structure of data block includes two main components, including transaction records and a blockchain header . Here, transaction records are organized in a Merkle tree based structure where a leaf node represents a transaction of a blockchain user. For example, a user can make a request with associated metadata (i.e. transferred money or contract) to establish a transaction that is also signed with the private key of user for trust guarantees. Meanwhile, the block header contains the following information: 1) hash of the block for validation, 2) Merkle root to store a group of transactions in each block, 3) nonce value which is a number that is generated by consensus process to produce a hash value below a target difficulty level, and 4) timestamp which refers to the time of when the block is created. A typical blockchain structure is illustrated in Fig. 4.\n- \\textit{Distributed ledger (database):} Distributed ledger is a type of database which is shared and replicated among the entities of a peer-to-peer network. The shared database is available for all network participants within the blockchain ecosystem. Distributed ledger records transactions similar to the process of data exchange among the members of the network. Participants of the network can achieve on the agreement by a consensus mechanism in a distributed environment where no third party is required to perform the transaction. For example, if a person joins the Bitcoin application, then he has to abide by all rules and guidelines which are established in the programming code of the Bitcoin application. He can make transactions to exchange currency or information with other members automatically without a third party such as a financial institution. In the distributed ledger, every record has a unique cryptographic signature associated with timestamp which makes the ledger auditable and immutable. \n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics [height=4.3cm,width=8.8cm]{Blockchain_concept.pdf}\n\t\\caption{The concept of blockchain operation.}\n\t\\label{fig11}\n\t\\vspace{-0.15in}\n\\end{figure}\n- \\textit{Consensus algorithms:} When nodes start to share or exchange data on a blockchain platform, there is no centralized parties to regulate transaction rules and preserve data against security threats. In this regard, it is vitally necessary to validate the block trustfulness, keep track the data flow and guarantee safe information exchange to avoid fraud issues, such as double-spending attacks . These requirements can be met by using validation protocols called as consensus algorithms. In the blockchain context, a consensus algorithm is a process used to reach agreement on a single data block among multiple unreliable nodes. An example of consensus applications is in Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin adopts a Proof of Work algorithm (PoW)  as an enabling consensus mechanism run by miners to ensure security in a untrusted network. Software on the network of miners uses their computation resources to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first miner solving the puzzle to create a new block will receive a reward as an encouragement for future mining contributions. However, a critical drawback of PoW is its high resource consumption which would be unsustainable in the future. As a result, other efficient consensus algorithms appears as strong alternatives, such as Proof-of-stake (PoS), Byzantine Faulty Tolerant (BFT). Details of conceptual features and related technical issues of such consensus algorithms can be referenced to previous excellent surveys , .\n- \\textit{Smart contracts:} A smart contract is a programmable application that runs on a blockchain network. Since the first smart contract platform known as Ethereum  was released in 2015, smart contracts have increasingly become one of the most innovative topics in the blockchain area. When we talk about smart contracts, the natural question is: What makes smart contracts so smart? This is due to their self-executing nature which means the codes will execute automatically the contractual clauses defined in the contract once the conditions have been met. For example, when a person signs a smart contract to transfer his funds, the funds will transfer automatically themselves over the blockchain network. Then the transfer information will be recorded as a transaction which is kept on the blockchain as an immutable ledger. Such a type of self-executing agreement relying on the code makes smart contracts unalterable and resistant to external attacks .\nIn addition to the capability of defining the operational rules and penalties around an agreement similar to the way a traditional contract does, smart contracts are capable of automatically enforcing their obligations to manage transactions. Particularly, smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without requiring the involvement of middlemen or third-party intermediaries . This property is particularly useful because it significantly reduces the issues of confliction and saves operation time as well as system costs. Therefore, smart contracts can provide cheaper, faster and more efficient options compared to the traditional systems in which contract conditions are always enforced physically by a central authority, enforcement mechanism or guidance system. With its programmable and automatic features, smart contracts offer a wide range of new applications to solve real-world problems, such as financial services and insurance, mortgage transactions, supply chain transparency, digital identity and records management .\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics [height=4.3cm,width=6.9cm]{BlockStructure.pdf}\n\t\\caption{The data block structure.}\n\t\\label{fig11}\n\t\\vspace{-0.15in}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{table*}[ht]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\caption{Main characteristics of blockchain and their potentials to 5G. }\n\t\\label{table}\n\t\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{5pt}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{3.5cm}|p{10cm}|}\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\centering \\textbf{Key characteristics of blockchain}& \n\t\t\\centering \\textbf{Description}&\t\n\t\t\\textbf{Potential applications to 5G networks and services}\n\t\t\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\textbf{Decentralization} &No central authority or trusted third party is needed to perform transactions. Users have full control on their own data.&Eliminate the need of trusted external authorities in 5G ecosystems, i.e. spectrum licenses, band managers, and database managers in spectrum management; central cloud/edge service manager in mobile computing and D2D networks; UAV control center in 5G UAV networks; and complex cryptographic primitives in 5G IoT systems. Decentralizing 5G networks potentially eliminates single-point failures, ensures data availability and enhance service delivery efficiency.  \n\t\t\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\textbf{Immutability}&It is very difficult to modify or change the data recorded in the blockchain.&Enable high immutability for 5G services. Spectrum sharing, data sharing, virtualized network resource provisions, resource trading can be recorded immutably into the only-appended blockchain. Besides, D2D communications, ubiquitous IoT networking and large-scale human-centric interconnections can be achieved via peer-to-peer networks of ubiquitous blockchain nodes without being modified or changed. The high immutability is very useful for 5G networks to performing accounting tasks, i.e. logging of session statistics and usage information for billing, resource utilization, and trend analysis.\n\t\t\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\textbf{Transparency} &All information of transactions on blockchain (i.e. public ledgers) can be viewable to all network participants. & Provide better localized visibility into 5G service usage. The same copy of records of blockchain spreads across a large network for public verifiability. This enables service providers and users to fully access, verify and track transaction activities over the network with equal rights. Also, blockchains potentially offer transparent ledger solutions for truly open 5G architectures (i.e. decentralized network virtualization, distributed edge computing, distributed IoT networks). Blockchain ledgers also support fair service trading applications (i.e. resource trading, payment) under the control of all network entities. \n\t\t\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\textbf{Security and privacy} & Blockchain employs asymmetric cryptography for security with high authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation. Smart contracts available on blockchain can support data auditability, access control and data provenance for privacy. & Provide high security for 5G networks involved in decentralized ledgers. Blockchain helps secure the 5G networks by providing distributed trust models with high access authentication, in turn enabling 5G systems to protect themselves and ensure data privacy. By storing data information (i.e. IoT metadata) across a network of computers, the task of compromising data becomes much more difficult for hackers. Besides, smart contracts, as trustless third parties, potentially support 5G services, such as data authentication, user verification, and preservation of 5G resource against attacks. \n\t\t\\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}", "cites": [5651, 1295], "cite_extract_rate": 0.2857142857142857, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "descriptive", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.3}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides a clear and factual description of blockchain components such as data blocks, distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts.

The global communication traffic has shown a drastic increase in recent years and is expected to continue, which triggers the appearance of the forthcoming generation of telecommunication networks, namely 5G, aiming to address the limitations of previous cellular standards and scope with such ever-increasing network capacity. The 5G network can outperform earlier versions of wireless communication technology and provide diverse service abilities as well as encourage full networking among countries globally , . 5G networks also provide solutions for efficient and cost-effective launch of a multitude of new services, tailored for different vertical markets with a wide range of service requirements. In particular, the advances in 5G communication are envisioned as opening up new applications in various domains with great impacts on nearly aspects of our life, such as IoT , smart healthcare , vehicular networks , smart grid , smart city .  Particularly, according to 3GPP and IMT-2020 vision , , the 5G technology is able to provide the following key capabilities:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item Provide 1-10Gbps connections to end points in the field and can reach up to 20Gbps in certain scenarios. \n\t\\item\tProvide ultra-low latency services (1ms or less than 1ms).\n\t\\item\tAchieve high mobility in the network (up to 500km/h). \n\t\\item\tEnable massive machine-type communication and support high dense network.\n\t\\item\tEnable Perception of 99.999\\% availability and 90\\% reduction in network energy usage.\n\t\\item\tEnable 10-100x number of connected devices with the ability to achieve ten year battery life for low power, machine-type devices.\n\t\\item\tEnable 1000x bandwidth per unit area.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn order to achieve such promising performance targets, the 5G networks  leverage a number of underlying technologies, such as cloud/ edge computing, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network functions virtualisation (NFV), network slicing, Device-to-Device Communications, Millimeter wave communication . \n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item \\textit{Cloud/edge computing:} Cloud computing has been introduced to meet the increasing demands for resource management, data storage, and mobile sensing in the 5G era. In specific, cloud computing paradigms with resourceful virtual computation centers can well support 5G services such as mobility/network management, resource offloading, and sensing services in various application domains . Meanwhile, as an extension of cloud computing, edge computing has emerged as the promising technology to empower 5G ecosystems. It provides computing services at the edge of the mobile network, with a close proximity to IoT devices, which enables computation and storage services with much lower transmission delays. \n\t\\item \\textit{Software defined networking (SDN):} Using software defined networks, it is possible to run the network using software rather than hardware. It also considers a split between control and data planes, thereby introducing swiftness and flexibility in 5G networks .\n\t\\item \t\\textit{Network functions virtualisation (NFV):} When using software defined networks, it is possible to run the different network functions purely using software. NFV enables decoupling the network functions from proprietary hardware appliances so they can run on standardized hardware . The key purpose of NFV is to transform the way networks are built and services are delivered. With NFV, any 5G service operators can simplify a wide array of network functions, as well as maximize efficiencies and offer new revenue-generating services faster and easier than ever before .\n\t\\item \\textit{Network slicing:} As 5G will require very different types of networks for the different applications, a scheme known as network slicing has been devices. By using SDN and NFV, it will be possible to configure the type of network that an individual user will require for his application. In this way the same hardware using different software can provide a low latency level for one user, whilst providing voice communications for another using different software and other users may want other types of network performance and each one can have a slice of the network with the performance needed.\n\t\\item \\textit{Device-to-Device (D2D) communication:} It allows IoT devices in close proximity to communicate together using a direct link rather than long signal transmissions via traditional base stations. By using D2D communication, 5G heterogeneous data can be transferred quickly between mobile devices in short range, which promises ultra-low latency for communication among users. Moreover, D2D connectivity will make 5G operators more flexible in terms of offloading traffic from the core network, improve spectral efficiency and eliminate unnecessary energy loss due to long data transmissions . \n\t\\item \\textit{Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication:} The mmWave communication technology gives new facilities with a tremendous amount of spectrum to 5G mobile communication networks to supply mobile data demands. It comes with a number of advantages including huge bandwidth, narrow beam, high transmission quality, and strong data access ability to overcome shortcomings caused by the explosive growth in mobile traffic volumes, unprecedented connected devices, and diversified use cases .\n\\end{itemize}\nIn the 5G networks, these above technologies will be used to meet the demands of diverse applications from the ongoing traffic explosion of connected devices. For example, the combination of cloud/edge computing and Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is regarded as the potential facilitators for flexible network deployment and operation. Moreover, the network slicing and D2D communication will enable ultra-reliable, affordable broadband access and intelligent use of network data to facilitate the optimal use of network resources with extremely low latency and high-speed device connection , .

Edge computing may have other names such as fog computing, mobile cloud or cloudlet. Similar to the cloud paradigm, edge computing can offer a series of computing services with capabilities of task processing, data storage, heterogeneity support and QoS improvements. In fact, edge servers are less powerful than remote clouds, but they are located at the edge of the network, with a close proximity to IoT devices, which enables highly efficient 5G data computation with much lower transmission delay, compared with the remote cloud . As a result, edge computing can provide instant computing applications to IoT users with low latency and fast service response, which would be particularly useful in the next generation services (i.e. in 5G and beyond). The distributed structure of edge computing also potentially brings numerous benefits, from ubiquitous computing services, scalability improvement to complexity reduction of network management to cope with the explosion of IoT devices and rapid growth of 5G service demands . However, its security is a significant challenge , . Indeed, the migration of 5G services, i.e. data computation, in the dynamic edge computing environments can be vulnerable to malicious attacks (such as jamming attacks, sniffer attacks, denial-of-service attacks, etc.). Further, the setting and configuration information by the edge service providers (ESP) must be trustworthy and secure, but in fact these are actually challenged due to the high dynamism and openness of the MEC system. Another challenge is to ensure data privacy and immutability for outsourced 5G heterogeneous data from external modifications or alternations. Importantly, how to avoid the system disruption caused by the attack on an edge node in the multi-edge computing  is of paramount importance for 5G-based edge computing networks. Fortunately, blockchain has come as a promising technical enabler to overcome most of security and networking challenges faced by the existing edge computing architectures. The same decentralization characteristic of both the blockchain and MEC built on the networking, storage, computation, communications makes their combination become natural. The recent research results have demonstrated that blockchain can be applied to the edge computing systems to support a number of services of security and management in edge computing . Generally, the blockchains can support edge computing-based 5G services in three main aspects: networking, storage and computation as shown in Fig. 6.\nIn fact, with the help of blockchain, the networking capability of edge networks can be optimized. The blockchain is employed in  to build a distributed and trusted authentication system to realize reliable authentication and information sharing among different edge-based IoT platforms. In the system, authentication data and user access information can be stored securely on blockchain, which is also capable of automatically tracking activities of mobile terminals (devices) without the need of central authorities. In particular, smart contracts are also utilized to perform trusted content catching in the edge computing network. Meanwhile, the works in ,  suggest a blockchain-based architecture for vehicular edge computing. Vehicular edge computing is introduced to provide data processing services with low latency, but it also raises privacy concerns since user information can be disclosed during the sharing process. The adaption of blockchain potentially solves such challenges by establishing a secure communication channel empowered by immutable transaction ledgers. Then, this robust and secure concept enables the energy flow and information flow to be protected against external malicious attacks when performing vehicular networking. Furthermore, ensuring security in the transmission process is one of the achievements of blockchain. The authors in ,  take advantage of blockchain to establish a security mechanism for edge computing-based energy systems where smart contracts are leveraged to build a trusted access control scheme for energy sharing and distribution. Further, the blockchain-based solutions can support efficient conditional anonymity and key management for the privacy-preserving authentication protocol without the need for other complex cryptographic primitives between network users. Moreover, to achieve a trustworthy and efficient edge computing system, the blockchain functionality is applied to the resource management , data sharing  or resource allocation , all of which improve edge computing performances while guaranteeing security properties of the network.\nIn addition, blockchain also provides security features for efficient data storage for edge computing systems. Indeed, blockchain can offer decentralized data storage enabled by the combined storage capacity of a network of peers to store and share contents. The work in  proposes a MEC-based sharing economy system by using the blockchain and off-chain framework to store immutable ledgers. Specifically, in a smart vehicular network, blockchain can keep information of the driver and the car profile with the history of maintenance, accident, and other car usage information. The raw vehicular data, i.e. vehicle sensor data, can be captured and processed by the MEC node under the control of the blockchain. Blockchain can also connect the stakeholders of a car through a shared chain and provide help in car-sharing economy scenarios. The work in  also proposes a blockchain database to secure communication between the home devices and sensors in the MEC-based smart city. In the sense of the ledger, blockchain can be regarded as a distributed database which keeps data by interconnecting a network of strongly immutable blocks. It is noting that the scalability of blockchain is a critical challenge due to the constrained ledger size, throughput and latency .  In this regard, the on-chain and off-chain storage concept can be very useful. For example,  in the vehicle context, the real-time updates regarding traffic and pollution of nearby roads can be stored locally in a cache unit for autonomous cars, while data hash values can be kept securely in blockchain. Any modifications on the storage unit can be acknowledged by blockchain via decentralized ledgers, improving the trustworthiness of the MEC-based network. Moreover, to facilitate easy access to data in a distrusted MEC blockchain setting, a decentralized big data repository platform, such as Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) can be necessary for improving storage capability on blockchain . On top of IPFS, several blockchain-based storage platforms such as Filecoin or Storij  have been applied as an incentive layer to form an entirely distributed file storage system. These blockchain database systems contain the off-chain service data while providing the on-chain identifier, so that data integrity can be checked by the identifier from the data and hash values in the blockchain and comparing it for monitoring. Such a blockchain platform is integrated with edge computing to solve storage risks caused by dynamic MEC .\nLastly, blockchain can support the computation processes in MEC networks. Specifically, blockchain can provide authentication capability to protect MEC systems. The study in  leverages blockchain features such as decentralization, tamper-proofing and consistency to build an authentication layer between edge/fog servers and IoT devices. The main objective is to monitor and verify all computing tasks offloaded to the MEC servers, which preserves edge computing from external attacks. In , smart contracts are employed for MEC to improve the efficiency of IoT computing, i.e. video coding, by providing a self-organized video transcoding and delivery service without a centralized authentication. Blockchain can protect the accuracy, consistency, and origins of the data files in a transparent way. Further, the transactional data are also encrypted and stored on blocks, which has the potential to achieve privacy and security for MEC .", "cites": [2145], "cite_extract_rate": 0.047619047619047616, "origin_cites_number": 21, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple works on blockchain and MEC, connecting common themes such as secure authentication, data storage, and computation.

Basically, NFV includes three main architectural components, namely Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) which supports the execution of VNFs, Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) that are the functions running on the NFVI, and Management and Network Orchestration (MANO) which cover the lifecycle management and orchestration of physical and software resources . NFV implements virtually Network Functions (NF) by decoupling hardware appliances (such as firewalls, gateways) from the functions that are running on them to provide virtualized gateways, virtualized firewalls and even virtualized components of the network, providing flexible network functions. In this way, the network operators can save significantly equipment costs and reduce operational expenditures as well as automate network operation tasks without concerning about hardware installation. Particularly, NFV envisions to provide a diverse number of benefits for 5G networks, including enhancing flexibility and scalability of NF deployments and connections thanks to the decoupling of software from hardware, optimizing resource provision of the VNFs for better cost and energy usage, and optimizing VNFs operations with maximum failure rate and tolerable unplanned packet loss . \nNetwork function virtualization and service function chaining, however, also incur new security challenges , . Since end-to-end service function chains may deploy NFVs in an environment involving multiple cloud providers, such data transmissions can be compromised by curious cloud entities, leading to data leakage concerns. Furthermore, in a virtualized scenario, tenants often share the same cloud infrastructure. In this context, the possibility of attacks inside the cloud can increase, which damage the transparency and accountability of service providers. In NFVs, virtualization servers can run on virtual machines (VM) to offer specific functions to execute distinct operating systems such as VM migration or resource allocation using orchestration protocols. However, the security for the communication between the orchestrator and the physical machines is a current challenge. In fact, these architectures are very sensitive to attacks that can come from different horizons. In fact, a VM can be created by an attacker to run in a server and leveraged to carry out external denial-of-service attacks. Besides, internal attacks from curious VMs are another concern which can adversely impact data integrity and confidentiality .  \nIn such a context, the blockchain technology has emerged as an efficient tool to help with these challenges. With the authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation natures, blockchain can facilitate NFV networks in three main aspects , . First, blockchain can enable reliable, easy and flexible orchestration of VNF services for better orchestration and network management. Second, blockchain can secure delivery of network functions and ensure system integrity against both insider attacks and external threats, i.e. malicious VM modifications and DoS attacks. Final, blockchain can perform data auditing and monitoring of system state during the network communication. We here review the latest advances in the use of blockchain to solve the above challenges for NFVs in 5G scenarios. \nThe authors of  propose a blockchain-based system called BSec-NFVO for secure management of service function chain orchestration operations in the Open Platform for Network Function Virtualization (OPNFV). A Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol is employed to prevent collusion attacks without compromising latency and throughput. The architecture of BSec-NFVO is depicted in Fig. 8, consisting of three main modules: the visualization module, which provides an interface between tenants and the NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) services; the orchestration module, which executes instructions transmitted by tenants via the visualization module; and lastly the blockchain module that verifies and confirms transactions before execution by the orchestration module. By immutably logging all instructions that manipulate service chains enabled by blockchain, the proposed scheme can ensure authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of instructions, which also provide data provenance and traceability in a multi-tenant and multi-domain NFV environment.\nThe work in  builds a blockchain-based Virtual Machine Orchestration Authentication (VMOA) framework to secure NFV/cloud orchestration operations for better authentication of orchestration commands in the lifecycle of cloud services. Here, blockchain acts as a decentralized database ledger shared between the virtualization server, the orchestrator and VM agents.  The virtualization server is able to authenticate the orchestration command via blockchain VMOA ledger in an immutable and secure manner. Due to the removing of the requirement of third parties in the VMOA and using security features of blockchain, the proposed solution potentially achieves superior advantages such as records integrity, fault tolerance, and network trustworthiness, compared to its centralized counterparts. \nAdditionally, to realize a faulty or compromised VNF configuration, the study in  introduces a blockchain-based architecture to provide auditability to orchestration operations of network slices for securing VNF configuration updates. The prototype implements two smart contracts with specific transaction formats for safeguarding network slice management and VNF configuration operations. Especially, a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform associated with certificate authorities is integrated to manage digital certificates of every node, improving auditability and that only certified and authorized nodes participate in the blockchain-based NFV network.\nThe authors of  introduce a scheme called BRAIN, a Blockchain-based Reverse Auction solution for Infrastructure supply in NFV scenarios for dealing with challenges of discovery and selection of infrastructures to host VNFs acquired by end users. Smart contracts are designed to achieve a trustworthy agreement between stakeholders such as users and infrastructure providers regarding resources contracted and configurations required. Meanwhile, to support efficiency and security in wireless virtualization, blockchain is proposed in  to improve the trust and transparency among participants and stakeholders and enable more seamless and dynamic exchange of spectrum and computing resources in the 5G wireless networks. \nAnother work  presents a blockchain-based architecture for the secure configuration management of virtualized network functions (VNFs). Thanks to the immutability and the traceability features provided by blockchain and integrity and consistency of transactions ensured by a consensus protocol, the proposed solution can provide security for VNF configuration state migration, building a trust mechanism between different infrastructure providers (tenants) and VNF vendors. Asymmetric keys are employed to develop a transaction model for building anonymous authentication of tenants and VNFs and gaining confidentiality of configuration data through encryption. Such transactions are then appended in the blockchain data structure which also gives traceability and accountability of the VNF configuration updates. \nMeanwhile, to realize the orchestration/management capabilities and business support systems in the context of architectural NFV, the research in  analyses blockchain-based Decentralized Applications (DApps) in support of multi-administrative domain networking. Blockchain can be an effective approach to establish an authentication layer for NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) services across administrative domains. For example, blockchain can verify user access and grant access permission to resources between providers NFV-MANO components. In such a context, a smart contract can be leveraged to store access permission and assets information for MANO components as well as perform mappings of the structure of quotas, access grants and capacity of NFV users for efficient resource usage.", "cites": [7973], "cite_extract_rate": 0.06666666666666667, "origin_cites_number": 15, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information well by grouping blockchain-based solutions for NFV under three main aspects: orchestration, security, and auditability.

Despite the technological achievements of 5G networks, the physical constraints such as spectrum limitations are still major limiting factors, which prevent operators from scaling their services properly. Spectrum scarcity in wireless networks hinders the fast improvement of throughput and service quality. Operators are forced to invest a large amount of money in their infrastructure to optimize the capacity by network densification and higher frequency reuse factors. Currently, MNOs have to face the challenges from the unavailability of usable frequency resources caused by spectrum fragmentation and the current fixed allocation policy, which prevents from meeting the requirements of the expanding market of wireless broadband and multimedia users . To deal with the desire of mobile users to be connected at all times, anywhere, and for any application, more spectrum bandwidth and/or more efficient usage of that bandwidth is urgently needed. Some solutions have been proposed, including the fixed spectrum allocation strategies, but these approaches are inefficient in terms of wasteful spectrum usage because the license holders (or primary users) do not continuously utilize their full spectrum allocation. One solution for addressing the spectrum scarcity problem in radio 5G networks is to introduce secondary users that opportunistically monitor the spectrum and then transmit their data whenever the spectrum is idle . However, spectrum sharing in such scenarios also raises security concerns and provides a central point of attack for malicious users. Another approach is to use certification authorities, providing provide certificates for cognitive radios inside each cell. This approach not only requires infrastructure to be implemented for each cell but also requires a protocol for defence against central-point attacks. Further, it requires greater calculation complexity and longer packet lengths, which increases overhead for spectrum sharing systems. Importantly, the use of such centralized architectures also adds single-of-failure bottlenecks when the authority is attacked or out of services, which leads to the disruption of the entire spectrum sharing network . \nIn comparison to such conventional spectrum management schemes, blockchain can be a much better solution to overcome the security and performance issues for spectrum management in 5G. Since blockchain is a form of decentralized database where no single party has control, blockchain can be applied to build spectrum sharing and management models with improved security and better performances, i.e. low latency and enhanced throughput. Especially, blockchain envisions to support spectrum management by providing the following benefits .  \n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item \\textit{Decentralization:} The blockchain adoption eliminates the need of trusted external authorities such as spectrum licenses, band managers, and database managers. The inherent benefits are twofold: reducing unnecessary network overhead due to communicating with the authorities during the spectrum sharing, and improving system integrity and privacy due to no concerns about data leakage caused by curious third party intermediaries. \n\t\\item \\textit{Transparency:} Since all transactions between spectrum users and service providers are reflected and recorded on distributed blockchain ledgers, the blockchain-based solution is able to provide better localized visibility into spectrum usage. Besides, blockchain can employ smart contracts, a self-executing platform, to perform auditability of spectrum sharing activities according to the pre-defined sharing policies. \n\t\\item \\textit{Immutability:} The spectrum services, i.e spectrum sharing, monitoring or user payment is recorded to the only-appended blockchain in an immutable manner. By using consensus mechanisms empowered by blockchain miners, blockchain ledgers is well resistant to modifications caused by attacks or malicious users. This also ensures the reliability of the spectrum services and enhances the accuracy of the network implementation. \n\t\\item \\textit{Availability:} Any network participants such as mobile users can access to spectrum resources managed by service providers to perform spectrum sharing and payment. Moreover, as blockchain broadcasts all service information to all entities, the spectrum sharing databases are also assessable to everyone in the network.  Furthermore, there is no central authority to verify or record the data and transactions, which potentially enables a more transparent system without a loss of security properties. \n\t\\item \\textit{Permissionless:} Because there is no single trusted entity as the central authority to control the network, new users or applications can be added to the overall system without seeking the approval of other users, providing a flexible sharing environment. \n\t\\item \\textit{Security:} Blockchains enable efficient communication between users and service providers with strong security capabilities against threats, DoS risks and insider attacks. \n\\end{itemize}\nIn spectrum management, verification and access management is also of significant importance for enabling secure spectrum sharing . In this work, blockchain can secure distributed medium-access protocol for cognitive radios (CRs) to lease and access available wireless channels. Blockchain is responsible for verifying and authenticating each spectrum-leasing transactions between primary and secondary users. Here, primary users are defined as spectrum license holders and can lease their allocated spectrum to increase spectrum efficiency as well as gain profits via a spectrum coin protocol. The blockchain performs exchanging currency, mining and updating the transactions, and leasing available spectrum through an auction. The authors also demonstrated that the blockchain adoption is beneficial to spectrum management in terms of better scalability, power efficiency in spectrum usage, improved accessibility with high degree of security and better system protection capability against DoS attacks and threats.\nThe work presented in  also describes a verification solution by taking advantage of blockchain for securing spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. The authors focus on building an auction protocol for spectrum payment services among primary users. Blockchain is regarded as a middle layer to perform spectrum trading, verify sharing transactions and lease securely the spectrum provided by a license holder. Besides, to solve the issues of privacy risks in spectrum sharing, a blockchain-based trustworthy framework called TrustSAS is presented in  for a dynamic spectrum access system (SAS) to enable seamless spectrum sharing between secondary users (SUs) and incumbent users. The TrustSAS scheme relies on permissioned blockchains to monitor and control systems and cluster activities as well as tackle spectrum sharing events by using a Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism. All spectrum sharing transactions are validated by BFT and signed by blockchain miners for immutable recording on blocks. The experimental results show the superior advantages in terms of efficient auditability, improved privacy and lower end-to-end latency for spectrum access. \nIn addition, a spectrum sensing platform empowered by blockchain has been proposed and referred to as Spectrum Sensing as a Service (Spass) , , which provide services of spectrum sensing trading and payment. Smart contract acts as the core component which is responsible for scheduling spectrum sensing among secondary users and helpers which are the nodes offering sensing service in the secondary user network. Based on operation rules defined in the contract, smart contracts also perform access verification by using a malicious helper detection mechanism to identify whether a helper is honest or malicious. The proposed solution not only maximizes the profits of MNOs to encourage spectrum provision for user applications but also guarantees security requirements in an untrusted and decentralized spectrum sharing setting. \nOne of the biggest problems for unlicensed spectrum utilization is the unfair competition between MNOs for the utilization of unlicensed spectrum resources which are free to use and quite often available. To cope with this challenge, the authors of  introduce a new unlicensed spectrum sharing among MNOs on blockchain. For this purpose, authors use smart contracts in conjunction with virtual cryptocurrency to develop a coalitional spectrum sharing game for optimizing spectrum allocation. The account balance of each MNO can be achieved fairly through a transparent sharing enabled by smart contracts, aiming to mitigate the conflict between MNOs during the sharing. To further improve spectrum sharing for sustainability in unlicensed frequency bands, the work in  proposes to build a brokering platform to facilitate the collaboration between the network stakeholders. In this context, blockchain is feasible to establish a secure sharing to implement automatic negotiation processes for spectral resources between access point (AP) operators in a reliable manner. \nMeanwhile, in the spectrum sharing environment between the aerial and terrestrial communication systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been used for facilitating communication on the sky. Currently, most UAVs in the market operate on the unlicensed spectrum (i.e., the industrial, scientific and medical bands) over the untrusted environment with significant security and privacy threats because of untrusted broadcast features and wireless transmission of UAV networks. To overcome such challenges, a spectrum blockchain architecture is considered in  to improve the spectrum sharing. To avoid wasteful spectrum usage in UAV network, a pricing-based incentive mechanism is proposed to encourage MNOs to lease their idle spectrum to a secondary UAV network to obtain some revenue from the UAV operators. Then, a secure spectrum sharing framework is introduced where blockchain uses immutable distributed ledgers to implement spectrum exchange while protect the sharing system from threats. The authors focus on developing a Stackelberg game for an optimal spectrum sharing strategy, which can maximize the profits of MNOs while provide security services for UAV-based networks.", "cites": [5652], "cite_extract_rate": 0.08333333333333333, "origin_cites_number": 12, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.8, "critical": 3.2, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from cited papers and connects them with a clear narrative on how blockchain can improve spectrum management in 5G.

Although the telecom operators provide mobile services with the implementation of small size networks which can deliver various advantages such as high data rate and low signal delay, it is likely to suffer from various issues such as inter-cell, intra-cell, and inter-user interferences . In the data-intensive service scenarios where a huge amount of mobile data is required to be transmitted in cellular networks, D2D communication can be a good choice to implement low-latency data transmission. However, the coexistence of D2D devices and cellular users in the same spectrum for communication and the short distance between D2D devices and users in small cells can result in cross-tier interference (CTI). The possibility of collaborating communication and sharing service benefits between mobile devices can be infeasible in practice due to the interest conflict between them. Building a fair and trusted economic scheme can be a solution to this problem, and thus mitigate the network interference. Currently, electronic money transactions have received extensive attention in small cell deployments, but the transaction consensus is often reached by passing a central authority . This approach not only incurs additional costs of latency and transmission energy, but also raises security concerns from third parties. Distributed interference management with blockchain would be a feasible approach to cope with such challenges and facilitate interference management. \nFor example, the authors in  present a first example of using distributed blockchain to support a linear interference network. The main objective is to build a monetary mechanism using blockchain for optimal interference management. More precisely, a network model for a pair of two nodes including a transmitter and receiver is considered, wherein the transmitter (payer) may cause interference at the receiver (payee). A distributed interference avoidance transmission strategy is proposed so that a node has to pay in order to be active and then maximizes its monetary credit. The blockchain implementation realizes the monetary policies for cooperative interference management using a greedy algorithm. The proposed strategy also relieved that blockchain can help allocate economic benefits among users for interference avoidance . \nIn the D2D networks, interference may incur from the unfair resource allocation from the service providers to different user types. For example, users with higher spectral resource demands should be prioritized during resource scheduling. Motivated by this, a blockchain consensus method is proposed in  to evaluate the amount of cross-tier interference (CTI) caused by each user. The authors pay special attention to building an access control mechanism using blockchain for the authenticity of channel state information (CSI) with a dynamic resource allocation. A user with higher CSI can be allocated a larger amount of wireless resource. A simulation implementation with an optimal user access algorithm is also presented, showing that the proposed scheme can improve the spectral efficiency for D2D users without interference effects. \nThe study in  utilizes power control with blockchain to support Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning for enabling efficient transmission of a macrocell user (MUE) and the time delay of femtocell users (FUEs) in blockchain-based femtocell networks. The macrocell base station (MBS) shares its spectrum resource to FUEs and the co-channel interference can be caused by the FUEs. In order to avoid excessive interference from FUEs, MBS can price the interference to the FUEs, the FUEs determine their transmission powers and payments with the constraint of time delay according to a modelled Stackelberg game. Blockchain is essential to build a decentralized femtocell network so that payment can be done in a reliable way without the involvement of a middle party. \nIn another scenario, the interference between IoT transaction nodes (TNs) in the blockchain-enabled IoT network is also analysed in . In this work, the authors focus on investigating the performance of blockchain transaction throughput and communication throughput by deriving the probability density function (PDF) with respect to the interference of TNs, for a transmission from an IoT node to a blockchain full function node. The blockchain-based solution is able to ensure high successful rate and overall communication throughput and preserve the IoT network against security threats.\nDespite great research efforts in the field, the use of blockchain for interference management in 5G mobile networks is still in its infancy with few investigated works. The preliminary findings from the literature works are expected to open the door for exploring blockchain in overcoming the challenges in network interference management in terms of network throughput and security.", "cites": [5653], "cite_extract_rate": 0.14285714285714285, "origin_cites_number": 7, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 3.5, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.0}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes several blockchain-based interference management approaches from different papers, linking them through the common theme of using blockchain to enable fair, decentralized, and secure economic mechanisms for mitigating interference in 5G networks.

Federated learning enables distributed model training using local datasets from distributed nodes such as IoT devices, edge servers but shares only model updates without revealing raw training data. More specific, it employs the on-device processing power and untapped private data by implementing the model training in a decentralized manner and keeping the data where it is generated. This emerging approach provides an ability to protect privacy of mobile devices while ensuring high learning performance and thus promises to play a significant role in supporting privacy-sensitive 5G mobile applications such as edge computing and catching, networking, and spectrum management .\nIn particular, the cooperation of blockchain and federated learning has been considered in recent works to solve complex issues in mobile 5G wireless networks. The authors in  introduce a blockchained federated learning (BlockFL) architecture which enables on-device machine learning without any centralized training data or coordination by employing a consensus mechanism in blockchain. By relying on the decentralized blockchain ledger, the proposed model overcomes the single point of failure problem and enhances the network federation to untrustworthy devices in a public network due to federated validation on the local training results. Besides, the blockchain also accelerate the training process by a reward mechanism, which in return promotes the collaboration of ubiquitous devices. \nThe study in  considers a reputation scheme which selects reliable mobile devices (workers) for federated learning to defend against unreliable model updates in mobile networks. To ensure accurate reputation calculation, a consortium blockchain with the properties of non-repudiation and tamper-resistance is leveraged to create a secure decentralized model update network of edge servers and mobile devices, leading to the reliability of federated learning on mobile edge computing. Importantly, blockchain associated with contract theory enables an incentive mechanism, which stimulates high-reputation workers with high-quality data to join the model training for preventing the poisoning attacks in federated learning . \nMeanwhile, the authors in  incorporate blockchain with federated learning in the determination of data relevance in mobile device networks. This can be done by encourage mobile users to aggregate relevant information belonging to a specific topic that they are seeking during the interaction process with other users. They also introduced a decentralized way of storing data which reduces the risk from centralized data storage. A consensus mechanism called the Proof of Common Interest is considered that provides data verification services to ensure that data that is added to the blockchain ledger is relevant. \nTo provide a parallel computing architecture for big data analysis, especially for the precision medicine which data sets are owned by healthcare data users, an integrated blockchain-federated learning model is proposed in . Federated learning assists training large medical data sets from various distributed data sources owned and hosted by different hospitals, patients, and health service providers, while blockchain-empowered smart contract is used to enable a distributed parallel computing environment for distributed deep learning using heterogeneous and distributed data. Moreover, the blockchain adoption enables secure, transparent, and auditable data sharing to promote international collaboration.\nThe work in  considers a blockchain empowered secure data sharing architecture for distributed devices in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The key focus is on building a data sharing with privacy preservation by incorporating in federated learning. By using the power of federation of IoT devices, the data privacy is ensured via the federated learning model which allows to share the data model without revealing the actual data. Further, to enhance the data integrity of the data training, the federated learning is integrated with the consensus process of permissioned blockchain, which also ensures secure data retrieval and accurate model training.", "cites": [602, 3473, 659, 5654], "cite_extract_rate": 0.5, "origin_cites_number": 8, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple papers that combine blockchain and federated learning for 5G applications, connecting their common themes such as privacy, decentralization, and trust mechanisms.

According to a survey work in , the privacy challenges in 5G come from various aspects, such as end-to-end data privacy, data sharing privacy, trust issues in information flows, and trust issues in centralized mobile data architectures with third parties. Blockchain with its decentralization, traceability, availability and trust capabilities has been demonstrated widely its great potential in solving privacy issues in 5G networks and services . As an example, blockchain is feasible to protect user data for decentralized personal data management , which enables to provide personalized services. Laws and regulations for data protection could be programmed into the blockchain so that they are enforced automatically. Interestingly, blockchain is capable of providing  full control of monitoring personal data when sharing on the network, which is unique from all traditional approaches which hinder users from tracking their data . \nTo provide decentralized and trusted data provenance services on cloud computing, the work in  uses blockchain to provide tamper-proof records and enable the transparency of data accountability. Blockchain can support in three steps, namely provenance data collection, provenance data storage, and provenance data validation. Data provenance record is published globally on the blockchain, where blockchain nodes (i.e. mobile users, data owners, and service providers) can participate in consensus for confirmation of every block.  During the data sharing between users and service providers, transmitted data can be highly vulnerable to malicious threats, i.e. data attacks, then privacy for shared data should be considered carefully. In this context, the authors in  presented a blockchain-based solution for secure data exchange. Data can be recorded in blocks and signed by miners so that sharing is securely implemented. An automated access-control and audit mechanism is considered wherein blockchain enforces user data privacy policies when sharing their data across third parties for privacy preservation . \nIn current IoT applications, the private information management often relies on centralized databases owned by third-party organizations for data services such as data processing, data storage, data sharing. However, it is easy to find that this architecture remains weaknesses in terms of data leakage coming from curious third parties and high communication latency due to such centralized models. A privacy architecture using blockchain for smart cities is presented in , focusing on solving the above issues. Blockchain has the potential to help mitigate privacy exposure while allowing users to benefit from trusted transactions and better data control. The records of data access are added to a transparent ledger so that blockchain with consensus mechanism can verify and validate the data requests from all users to detect any potential threats in a decentralized manner without the involvement of any third parties. In another research effort, the work in  investigates how blockchain can support secure data storage and data availability in IoT health networks. With the combination of the cryptographically secured encryption and the common investment of the network peers via a consensus mechanism, blockchain empowers a decentralized and openly extendable network while protecting data on the network. \nA privacy-preserved scheme empowered by blockchain is also considered and discussed in . In this work, a consortium blockchain-oriented approach is designed to solve the problem of privacy leakage without restricting trading functions in energy networks. Both energy users and suppliers are verified by a trading smart contract so that all trading transactions are authenticated for trustworthiness. Moreover, to achieve good privacy in industrial IoT, the study  introduces a decentralized blockchain architecture in conjunction with a hash algorithm and an asymmetric encryption algorithm. IoT data are still stored by the offline database (i.e. cloud storage), and the access record (storage, reading, and control) of each entity is stored in the block for tracking. Therefore, data storage on blockchain can be solved efficiently, and each operation will be strictly supervised via blocks.  \nIn dealing with privacy issues in vehicular networks, the authors of  present a privacy-preserving authentication framework. The main goal of the proposed system is to preserve the identity privacy of the vehicles in the vehicular ad hoc networks. All the certificates and transactions are recorded immutably and securely in the blockchain to make the activities of vehicles (i.e. data sharing, energy trading) transparent and verifiable. In a similar direction, a model called CreditCoin for a novel privacy-preserving incentive announcement solution is presented in . On the one hand, by offering incentives to users, CreditCoin can promote data sharing for network expansion, and the transactions and account information of blockchain are also immutable and resistant to be modified by attacks. On the other hand, with a strongly linked ledger, the blockchain controller can be easy to trace user activities, including malicious behaviours, for data protection. \nIn addition, the work in  proposes to use private smart contracts to design a privacy-preserving business protocol in e-commerce. In the contract, the interaction policy is defined via a business logic that determines types of trade, counterparties, underlying assets, and price information of the online shopping. The transactions between the seller and the buyer can be implemented securely and transparently via the contract without the disclosure of private information. Recently, the blockchain benefit to privacy of machine learning algorithm implementation is investigated in . A privacy-preserving and secure decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm is established on blockchain, which enables computation in a decentralized manner in computing nodes. Computation parameters and information are kept in the block without revealing their own data and being compromised by data attacks. Obviously, the blockchain technology is promising to privacy preservation in the modern mobile networks and services, especially in 5G IoT systems, where data protection is becoming more important in the context of exponential mobile data growth in the 5G era .", "cites": [8937], "cite_extract_rate": 0.0625, "origin_cites_number": 16, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 2.5, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes information from multiple blockchain-based privacy solutions in 5G and IoT contexts, effectively connecting ideas such as data provenance, decentralized control, and secure transactions.

Access control mechanisms guarantee that only legitimate users, devices or machines are granted permissions (e.g., read, write, etc.) the resources in a network, database, services and applications. Blockchain, especially smart contracts can offer access control capability to protect the involved system against any threats. As an example, a trustworthy access control scheme leveraging smart contracts is introduced in  to implement access right validation for IoT networks. The access policy is predefined and stored in the contract, which runs on blockchain. The contract can verify the user request using such a policy in a dynamic and decentralized manner. Different from traditional access control architectures which always use external authority for verification, the blockchain-based approach can perform direct access control between the requestor and the data centre so that the access latency can be reduced and security is improved.\nTo achieve access control for user requests to data resources in fog cloud-based IoT networks, a privacy-oriented distributed key management scheme using blockchain is proposed in  to achieve hierarchical access control. To receive a permission grant for data access, a subject needs to send a request with access information (i.e. identification, user address) to the security manager which checks the access and broadcast this request to other entities for verification via blockchain. The access is granted only when a consensus is achieved among all entities, which enhances reliability of the access control architecture. \nTo overcome the challenges caused by complicated access management and the lack of credibility due to centralization of traditional access control models, the authors in  introduce an attribute-based access control scheme. The ultimate goal is to simplify the access management by a distributed blockchain ledger while providing efficient access control ability to safeguard IoT data resources. Moreover, the work in  introduces a combination of Ethereum blockchain and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to realize fine-grained access control for cloud storage. An access control policy is programmed in a smart contract which verifies the request based on the access period time and the attributes of data users. All information of control functionality results is stored on the blockchain, so the access control is visible to all users. \nMeanwhile, a transaction-based access control scheme based on blockchain is proposed in . The access verification follows a four-step procedure: subject registration, object escrowing and publication, access request and grant. Each request of the subject is registered as a transaction that is then submitted to blockchain to be validated by the data owner on blockchain by suing a Bitcoin-type cryptographic script. The works in ,  also investigate the capability of blockchain for realizing access control services with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric platforms. To perform access control in the large-scale IoT networks, a platform called BlendCAC is considered in  as a promising solution for securing data sharing and resource trading among devices, users and service providers.

The emerging 5G technologies are potential to support smart healthcare applications, which fulfill the new requirements for healthcare such as improved QoS, better density and ultra-high reliability . The integration of blockchain with 5G technologies can advance current healthcare systems and provide more performance benefits in terms of better decentralization, security, privacy , service efficiency and system simplification for lower operational costs .  Blockchain can incorporate with 5G technologies such as softwarization, cloud/edge computing for new smart healthcare services  as depicted in Fig. 12.  The softwarized infrastructure can perform network functions through NFVs, which promote IoT communication, while cloud computing can support fast healthcare delivery services for early detection of patient health conditions. In such a 5G healthcare scenario, blockchain is employed to build a peer-to-peer database system which can validate and record all transactions (i.e. healthcare request, patient data) and store immutably them in decentralized ledgers. All transaction blocks are also visible to healthcare network members, including doctors, clinicians, and patients to accelerate data sharing during medications and treatment processes. \nBlockchain is also integrated with SDN-based healthcare networks  for healthcare networking and computing. A software-defined infrastructure is designed to facilitate the specification of home-based healthcare services, and a cloud edge model is considered to provide a flexible heterogeneous health computation services.

An example is presented in  wherein blockchain is incorporated with the D2D technology for large scale feature extraction applications on cloud. In healthcare, for example, image features extracted from health data collection contain important information of patients and thus need to be secured. Blockchain would ensure secure data storage by shifting the information to decentralized ledgers which are maintained by all participants. All stored data on blockchain is signed digitally and identified by hash values, which also solve privacy leaking issues from tampering or forging.  \nRecently, blockchain is also considered and investigated in mobile edge computing (MEC)-empowered healthcare applications. The authors in  consider an edge blockchain for telemedicine applications, with the main objective of providing secure transmission and computation of health data. The MEC-based cellular health network  contains a base station and a set of mobile users. Here, mobile users can access the Internet via the cellular network, and they share the computation resources of a MEC server linked with a base station in a small cell. Blockchain provides a consensus protocol to verify the patient priority which is defined as the level of wireless resources that a user needs for their computation. As a result, the optimal resource allocation can be achieved to ensure the quality of data transmission of the whole network, and user information is secured due to storing on blockchain ledgers. Another blockchain approach in edge-based mass screening applications for disease detections is presented in .

Despite the potential vision of smart cities, how to provide smart city services with high efficiency and security remains unsolved. In this scenario, blockchain can be a promising candidate to solve critical security issues and empower smart city services , . To simplify the management of smart city services on a large scale, a city can be divided into small blocks called smart blocks.

A private blockchain using a ledger database is important to securely store all information generated from IoT devices during data exchange, data offloading and computation services. \nAnother research in  analyses a sustainable IoT architecture empowered by blockchain for a secure sharing economy services in mega smart cities. The proposed system employs cognitive fog nodes at the edge to gather and process offloaded multimedia payload and transactions from a mobile edge node and IoT devices. To extract significant information from the outsourced data, machine learning is used during the data analytic, and such results are then put in blockchain for secure sharing and storage. Furthermore, to solve data security issues in IoT for smart cities, blockchain is considered in  to secure communication between the smart city and home devices and sensors. IoT data can be executed and computed at the edge layer for latency reduction, while user access information is recorded by blockchain, which works as a universal ledger. The key benefits of the proposed scheme include system transparency as well as the permissionless property which allows adding any new IoT devices without involving any authorities. \nIn 5G smart cities, a prohibitively large amount of surveillance data will be generated continuously from ubiquitous video sensors. It is very challenging to immediately identify the objects of interest or detect malicious actions from thousands of video frames on the large scale. In such a context, building a distributed edge computing networks is highly efficient to achieve scalable data computation , . From the security perspective, blockchain would be a natural choice to establish decentralized security solutions by interconnecting edge nodes, IoT devices and city users, where data sharing, computation and business transactions can be performed on the blockchain ledger platform. It is also demonstrated that the use of distributed blockchain provides more benefits than the centralized architectures with a central cloud server in terms of lower latency, energy consumption, better service delivery, faster user response with security and privacy guarantees . \nCurrently, most Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) which monitors the connections between transportation providers and passengers in smart cities is controlled by a central MaaS manager, which potentially introduces privacy leakage and system disruptions if this entity is attacked. By integrating with the blockchain, the MaaS model can be operated in a much more secure and decentralized manner . In this work, blockchain can help improve trust and transparency for all stakeholders and eliminate the need of centralized entity to make commercial agreements on MaaS. The mobility services, such as ticket purchase or payments for using transports, can be programmed by smart contracts, which enable automatic and reliable service trading and payment. \nCloud computing is also a promising technology which can be incorporated to support strong computation and storage capabilities for smart city data, i.e big data from ubiquitous IoT devices. A cloud-smart city architecture is introduced in , wherein big data processing can be performed by cloud servers, while data auditing can be achieved by using the blockchain without third party auditors (TPAs). The proposed scheme focuses on building an optimized blockchain instantiation called data auditing blockchain (DAB) that collects auditing proofs and employs a consensus algorithm using a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) protocol. The simulation results reveal the potential of the blockchain adoption for big data in smart city with lower communication costs and better security. Furthermore, blockchain can enable interconnection cloud service providers to achieve a larger scale computation service . Any cloud server can be regarded as a blockchain node and cloud computing events are recorded on the ledgers, which effectively improves the system robustness and avoids the risks of single points of failures once the cloud server is compromised or attacked.", "cites": [5659], "cite_extract_rate": 0.09090909090909091, "origin_cites_number": 11, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 4.0, "critical": 3.0, "abstraction": 3.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section synthesizes multiple cited papers to present a coherent narrative on how blockchain can enhance smart city applications in 5G networks, particularly in surveillance, data auditing, and mobility services.

Blockchain is particularly useful to create secure sharing environments for spectrum or data exchange in the 5G mobile networks.  Blockchain is regarded as a middle layer to perform spectrum trading, verify sharing transactions and lease securely the spectrum provided by spectrum resource providers, i.e. license holders. Different from the conventional database management systems which often use a centralized server to perform access authentication, blockchain with smart contracts can implement decentralized user access validation by using the computing power of all legitimate network participants. This makes the sharing system strongly resistant to data modifications. Many research studies on blockchain , , ,  demonstrate that the blockchain adoption is beneficial to spectrum management in terms of better scalability, power efficiency in spectrum usage, improved accessibility with high degree of security and better system protection capability against DoS attacks and threats. \nBesides, blockchain can simplify the network virtualization in 5G networks with high degrees of security , . The blockchain technology can provide the required characteristics of nonrepudiation and immutability to overcome the shortcomings of the previous centralized configuration settings in virtual networks. More precisely, blockchain is capable of creating secure virtual wireless networks (VWNs) so that wireless resource-owners sublease their wireless resources (e.g., slice of RF spectrum, infrastructure) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In such a decentralized virtual network, smart contracts can be very useful to provide automation and transparency in a distributed way instead of trusting a particular node or an authority process transactions, which also enhances the trustworthiness of the resource management services. The building of a fair and trusted economic scheme empowered by blockchain can be a notable solution for network interference control, especially in small cell deployments . \nIn addition to the above 5G services, blockchain also provides privacy and security benefits to 5G networks. By publishing user data to ledger where data is signed by hash functions and appended immutably to blocks, blockchain platforms ensure strong data protection. Blockchain is capable of providing full control of personal data when sharing on the network, which is unique from all traditional approaches which hinder users from tracking their data .

Here, we analyse the scalability issues of blockchain from the perspectives of throughput, storage and networking.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item \\textit{Throughput: }In fact, blockchain has much lower throughput in comparison to non-blockchain applications. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum process only a maximum of 4 and 20 transactions per second respectively, while Visa and PayPal process 1667 and 193 transactions per second  respectively. Obviously, the current blockchain systems have serious scalability bottlenecks regarding the number of replicas in the network as well the performance concerns such as constrained throughput (number of transactions per second) and latency (required time for adding a block of transactions in the blockchain) .  Many blockchains have long waiting time for transactions to be appended into the chain because of block size limitations. Therefore, the block generation time increases rapidly, which limits the overall system throughput. Therefore, in order to sustain a huge volume of real world transactions for 5G applications, proper solutions should be considered carefully to improve the throughput. \n\\item\t\\textit{Storage:} When using blockchain in 5G networks, a huge quantity of data generated by ubiquitous IoT devices is processed by the blockchain for 5G services such as data sharing, resource management and user transaction monitoring. In the conventional blockchain systems, each blockchain node must process and store a copy of the complete transaction data. This can pose a storage and computation burden on resource-constrained IoT devices to participate in the blockchain network. Moreover, if all transaction data are stored on chain, the blockchain capacity will become very large to maintain on the chain over time .\n\\item\t\\textit{Networking:} Blockchain networking is another issue that also affects the scalability of blockchain systems. Blockchain is computationally expensive and requires significant bandwidth resources to perform computational mining puzzle. However, in the 5G scenarios, such as ultra-dense networks where resource is very limited due to the demands from IoT devices and service operators, it may be impossible to meet resource requirement for blockchain to achieve large scale transaction processing. Further, stemming from the property of blockchain consensus mechanisms which require multiple transaction transmissions among nodes to validate a block, the blockchain operation needs to consume much network resources (i.e. bandwidth, mining power, and transmission power), which also results in high network latency . \n\\end{itemize}\nConsidering complex 5G IoT scenarios, i.e. smart cities, the IoT workload and data are enormous and thus will result in the rapid growth in the IoT blockchain size, making it difficult to process high volumes of data. The end-to-end latency in 5G networks is expected to achieve less than 1 millisecond  for payload and data transmissions. This vision requires careful considerations in designing blockchain platforms before integrating into 5G systems. Many research efforts have been dedicated to improving the performance and scalability in blockchain from different design perspectives such as mining hardware design , hybrid consensus protocols , on-chain and off-chain solutions , . Very recently, a solution using 5G network virtualization is also considered  to solve scalability of blockchain by decoupling the blockchain management from the transaction processing to improve QoS of blockchain operations. The preliminary results are expected to shed light on the blockchain research for solving scalability issues and improving the system performance in integrated blockchain 5G networks.", "cites": [1295], "cite_extract_rate": 0.1, "origin_cites_number": 10, "insight_result": {"type": "analytical", "scores": {"synthesis": 2.5, "critical": 2.0, "abstraction": 2.5}, "insight_level": "medium", "analysis": "The section provides an analytical overview of blockchain performance and scalability challenges in the context of 5G, identifying key issues like throughput, storage, and networking.

However, recent studies have revealed inherent security weaknesses in blockchain operations which are mostly related to 5G systems . A serious security bottleneck is 51\\% attack which means that a group of miners controls more than 50\\% of the network’s mining hash rate, or computing power, which prevents new transactions from gaining confirmations and halts payments between service providers and IoT users. Seriously, adversaries can exploit this vulnerability to perform attacks, for example, they can modify the ordering of transactions, hamper normal mining operations or initiate double-spending attack, all of which can degrade the blockchain network . In addition, the security aspect of smart contract, which is regarded as core software on blockchain, is also very important since a small bug or attack can result in significant issues like privacy leakage or system logic modifications , . Some of the critical security vulnerabilities can include timestamp dependence, mishandled exceptions, reentrancy attacks on smart contracts in 5G applications.\nIn addition to that, in current 5G IoT systems, data can be stored off-chain in cloud computing to reduce the burden on blockchain. However, this storage architecture can arise new privacy concerns. Specifically, an autonomous entity can act as a network member to honestly perform the cloud data processing, but meanwhile obtains personal information without the consent of users, which leads to serious information leakage issues. External attacks can also gain malicious access to retrieve cloud data, or even alter and modify illegally outsourced IoT records on cloud. Besides, privacy leakage on blockchain transactions is another significant problem. Although blockchain uses encryption and digital signature to preserve transactions, recent measurement results  show that a certain amount of transaction is leaked during blockchain operations and data protection of blockchain is not very robust in practice. Furthermore, criminals can leverage smart contracts for illegal purposes, facilitating the leakage of confidential information, theft of cryptographic keys. Importantly, privacy of IoT users cannot be ensured once they join the network. Indeed, by participating in the blockchain network, all information of users such as address of sender and receiver, amount values is publicly available on the network due to the transparency of blockchain. Consequently, curious users or attacks can analyse such information and keep track of activities of participants, which can lead to leakage of information secrets such as personal data. \nSecurity problems in blockchain in 5G networks can be solved by recent security improvements. For example, a mining pool system called SmartPool  was proposed to improve transaction verification in blockchain mining to mitigate security bottlenecks, such as 51\\% vulnerability, ensuring that the ledger cannot be hacked by increasingly sophisticated attackers. Particularly, recent works ,  introduced efficient security analysis tools to investigate and prevent threat potential in order to ensure trustful smart contract execution on blockchain.

The foundation of the efficient and secure operation of blockchain is a computation process known as mining. In order to append a new transaction to the blockchain, a blockchain user, or a miner, needs to run a mining puzzle, i.e. Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) which is generally complicated and requires vast computing and storage resources. Further, blockchain also requires network bandwidth resources to perform its consensus process. Without a careful design, the blockchain implementation to operate involved IoT applications may lead to Quality of Service (QoS) degradation with long latency, high energy consumption, high bandwidth demands, and high network congestion. Obviously, the integration of blockchain can introduce new QoS challenges that would negatively impact the overall performance of blockchain-5G networks. It is noting that one of the most important goals of future 5G is to provide user-centric values with high QoS to satisfy the growing demands of user traffic and emerging services . Therefore, it is vitally important to develop efficient solutions that can enhance service qualities of blockchain ecosystems to empower the future blockchain-5G networks. \nRecently, some strategies have been proposed to solve the above issues from different perspectives. On the one hand, the design of lightweight blockchain platforms can be a notable solution to enhance the QoS, by eliminating computation consensus mechanisms of blockchain , compressing consensus storage , or designing lightweight block validation techniques , , . These solutions potentially simplify the blockchain mining process for lower energy consumption and better latency efficiency, which make greats contributions to the QoS improvements in blockchain-5G applications. On the other hand, computation offloading is also another feasible approach to solve the low QoS issues of blockchain . With the development of 5G technologies such as edge/cloud computing, SDN, D2D communication, blockchain computation tasks (i.e. consensus puzzle) can be offloaded to resourceful servers such as edge/cloud servers ,   by combining SDN  and D2D communication  to bridge the gap between constrained resources of local mobile devices and growing demands of executing the computation tasks. By using offloading solutions, the performance of blockchain-5G systems would be improved significantly, such as saving system energy, reducing computation latency and improving the quality of computation experience for mobile devices. As a result, the system QoS will be enhanced while blockchain features are ensured for high level network security.
